While DST's core offer remains automated monitoring and control, our professional engineering staff is purposely diverse in their respective formal training (degrees) and previous work experience. DST's technical-team roster includes: control engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, computer science engineers, and our "trained-in-the-trenches" Technicians.  Yet, just as our wide-ranging customers are united by their common need to, in some way, monitor and control mass and data, so our multi-disciplined engineering staff is united in the meeting of that need.
