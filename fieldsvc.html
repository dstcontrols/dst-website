DST Controls' professional and technical staff can be dispatched on a moment's notice to customer sites anywhere in the world. DST's field & emergency service program, "Redi-Serve," guarantees that DST engineers or technicians&mdash;specifically trained on a customer's systems&mdash;will be standing-at-the-ready to get production back up and running in case of problems.
<br><br>
Redi-Serve customers in the San Francisco Bay area can contract for a guaranteed on-site  response time of as little as four-hours, 24 X 7. And with the Redi-Serv pager option, customers can also directly page the specific DST personnel already trained to trouble shoot that customer's equipment. When contact is made, the customer can avail themselves of phone support then and there, or they request an immediate site visit.
<br><br>
DST can also provide on-line (web, dial-up, or VPN) monitoring and support for systems requiring <i>maximum</i> assurance of uptime.
