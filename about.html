<tr><td>
Founded in 1975 by Bill Southard, P.E., DST Controls is a full service control systems and industrial data integration company that serves customers on five continents with <i>on-spec, on-budget, and on-time</i> project delivery.
<br><br>
DST's core offer is automated control and monitoring of industrial equipment, processes, and data. As a control and data systems integrator, DST accomplishes its mission by using proven, off-the-shelf hardware and software solutions when possible, and <i>inventing</i> effective hardware and software solutions when necessary. 
<br><br>
Our professional multi-disciplined staff provides control, automation, and data collection systems to a wide range of industries:  From pharmaceuticals to refineries; from water treatment to power-grid substations; from vibration-dampening systems for satellite launch vehicles to automated quality control systems for bottling lines&mdash;if processes, equipment, or industrial data flow need automating, DST Controls is the systems integrator to do it.
<br><br>
We purposely maintain this "broadband" experience and varied customer-base to not only keep our highly trained technical staff on their toes&mdash;and excited about coming to work each day&mdash;but also to shorten their learning-curve on new customer applications. This works effectively because...<br>
<ol type="a">
	<li>having so much experience already under our belts increases the likelihood that we will already be familiar with critical aspects of any new customers' situations; and</li>
	<li>having to regularly come-up-to-speed-quickly on new customer situations&mdash;and then immediately innovate solutions for them&mdash;at once tests, and strengthens, two of DST's core competencies: <b><i>Learning & Innovating</i></b>.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Moreover, DST's being at home in diverse environments also allows for occasional "cross-pollination" of solutions invented for one industry to be effectively applied in another. Hence, DST is often the "Go-to integrator" when a project's technical requirements may stymie other engineering groups.
