Protecting delicate controls, electronics, and wiring from acrid 
            industrial environments and the occasional out-of-control forklift 
            is no easy task. However, it is easier in some places than in 
            others. Not all enclosures specified by control engineers end up 
            enduring industrial hazards. Of the 211 respondents to <I>Control 
            Engineering's </I>recently e-mailed research questionnaire, many had 
            less demanding duty in mind.</P>
            <P>The survey by <I>Control Engineering </I>and Reed Research 
            (Newton, MA) looked at a wide variety of topics of interest to 
            enclosure specifiers. Questionnaire topics included:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Primary applications for enclosure use 
              <LI>Types of protection specified 
              <LI>Types of cooling specified 
              <LI>Principal areas of application 
              <LI>Levels of protection specified 
              <LI>Types of materials specified 
              <LI>Current and future purchasing plans. </LI></UL>
            <P>Results of the online survey showed that the majority (79%) of 
            those responding were directly involved in specifying, recommending, 
            and/or buying enclosures. Of these respondents, 48% were involved in 
            specifying enclosures for in-plant requirements, 21% for OEM 
            (resale) requirements, with the remainder making buying decisions 
            for both in-plant and OEM requirements. </P>

            where?</STRONG></A> 
            <P>Of those applications destined for direct use by the control 
            engineer, the greatest majority will see duty on the plant floor (as 
            the graphic shows). These applications are generally considered 
            benign. However, exposure to dust, dirt, vibration, heat, cold, 
            EMI/RFI, natural disasters, and physical abuse are all possible in 
            ordinary in-plant environments. Additionally, security and 
            resistance to tampering and vandalism are frequently considered when 
            an enclosure is specified.</P>

            <P>Hazardous-duty environments remain among the more specific uses 
            for enclosures.</P>
            <P>According to <B>Bill Southard, president of DST Controls (Benicia, 
            CA)</B>, ''It used to be that Class I, Div. 1 (or 2) meant putting a 
            size 0 motor starter in a 300-lb enclosure that looked like it was 
            made in the former Soviet Union.</P>
            <P>''Today, thanks to National Fire Protection Association standards 
            and Z-Purge capability, these same enclosures can be smaller, 
            lighter, and much less costly. There are still areas in a few 
            industries that require explosion-proof enclosures, but most 
            integrators today will try to use a purged enclosure in the 
            classified area.''</P><A name="Not so tough duty"><STRONG>Not so 
            tough duty</STRONG></A> 
            <P>According to the survey, almost as many enclosures find their way 
            into office environments as hazardous duty or sanitary/washdown 
            environments. Function of these enclosures cannot be overlooked. 
            Office environment applications of enclosures include heating, 
            ventilation, and air-conditioning, behind-the-walls accommodation of 
            electrical terminations, server room electronics containment, 
            protection of modems, remote environmental monitoring devices, and 
            utility services. Other non-factory, but not strictly ''office,'' 
            environment applications for enclosures can include marine/dockside 
            uses, commercial construction/equipment, underground tunnel 
            services, and analysis labs. </P>
            <P>According to Mike Jackson, engineering manager at Stahlin 
            Non-Metallic Enclosures (Belding, MI), ''Non-factory users of 
            enclosures have been a leader in the specification of thermoset 
            fiberglass enclosures. Non-factory applications have been a key 
            driver for manufacturers of non-metallic enclosures to develop new 
            enclosure products and accessories. Because the public more often 
            views these products, designers are more apt to look at the 
            enclosure design and material as an integral part of the overall 
            product design/function compared to enclosures for factory use.'' 
            </P>
            <P>Enclosures are ubiquitous and the need to correctly specify them 
            is an absolutely necessary in the control engineering design 
            process. With today's expanded enclosure offerings, preparing this 
            first line of defense for control equipment has been made simpler 
            and more convenient.</P>
