<b><i>Validation:</i></b><br>
More and more industries are emulating pharmaceutical manufacturers and nuclear facilities in requiring detailed and irrefutable validation and documentation of their plants and processes. 
<br><br>
              DST's Validation Department provides thousands of cost-effective 
              man-hours per year to customers in regulated industries. DST's Validation 
              Services (per GAMP 5) include: 
              <ul>
	<li>Hazards Analysis of Critical Control Points
	<li>FMEA Analysis
	<li>Generation of Functional Specifications
	<li>Generation of Hardware Design Specifications
	<li>Generation of Software Design Specifications
	<li>Generation and execution of Installation Qualification protocols
	<li>Preparation of Installation Qualification Exceptions and Final Reports
	<li>Generation and execution of Operational Qualification protocols
	<li>Preparation of Operational Qualification Exceptions and Final Reports
	<li>Generation of Traceability Matrices
	<li>Generation and execution of Facility Qualification protocols
	<li>Preparation of Facility Qualification Exceptions and Final Reports
	<li>Generation and execution of Process Validation protocols
	<li>Preparation of Process Validation Exceptions and Final Reports
</ul>
Again, as with most of DST services, project-size and location are rarely a problem.

<b><i>Documentation:</i></b><br>
One of DST's core precepts is, "Customers should own their own systems." Yet such can eventuate <i>only</i> if the functionally effective and robust systems we regularly provide are accompanied by detailed and conventionally-formatted documentation.  Hence DST documentation packages for all its engineered systems, software, and control panels include:
<ul type="disc">

	<li>Wiring diagrams
	<li>Panel layout drawings
	<li>Complete BOMs
	<li>PLC ladder diagrams
	<li>Fully annotated computer code
	<li>Test documentation
	<li>Operations Manuals (when required)
</ul>
DST can also generate current and complete "As-Found" documentation packages of systems provided by others. Plant or system owners might need this service when...
<ul type="disc">
	<li>a system undergoes changes over time&mdash;but the documentation <i>doesn't</i>; or
	<li>a system's original documentation is lost; or 
	<li>a system's documentation was inadequate from the start.
</ul>
Current and complete documentation is indispensable when system upgrades, enhancements, service (repairs)&mdash;or outright system-replacement&mdash;is being implemented, procured, or even just considered.
