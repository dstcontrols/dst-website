Three reasons why industrial owners making their plants and processes safer are:
<ul>
<li>Wider acceptance of owners' moral responsibility to provide safe work places 
<li>Increasing regulatory scrutiny 
<li>Greater awareness of <i>total</i> costs of an industrial accident, which include...
	<ul>
		<li>Plant downtime
		<li>Litigation costs and damages
		<li>Executive and staff distraction & diminished moral
		<li>Insurance premium increases
		<li>Emergency or enforced safety up-grades cost more than planned ones
		<li>Lost productivity while replacement workers are hired and ramp-up 
	
	</ul>
</ul>
For over 30 years DST has been employing industrial automation technologies and 
        <i>safe thinking</i> to make our customers' plants and processes less 
        hazardous and fully OSHA-compliant. We accomplish this by implementing 
        control-based solutions designed by our own safety team, or by our customers' 
        safety specialists. These safety solutions can involve our assistance 
        in original system design, DST-retrofitted safety systems, DST-designed 
        and installed hard guarding (barriers), safety-specific updates of O&amp;M 
        documentation, and safety-specific operator training. <br>
        <br>
For customers requiring formal or more comprehensive safety audits and risk assessments, DST has partnered with Lewis Bass International (LBI), Safety Consultants (<a href="http://www.lewisbass.com">http://www.lewisbass.com</a>) to provide fully OSHA and/or EU compliant single-source safety solutions. LBI provides safety consultation anywhere in the world and DST can provide safety system integration anywhere in the world. 
<br><br>
Examples of DST-implemented safety systems include...
<ul>
	<li>Toxic Gas Delivery Systems
	<li>Molded Fiber and Robotic Processes
	<li>Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Systems
	<li>Steel Pipe Mill
	<li>Packaging Systems
	<li>Fruit Pitting Systems
	<li>Machine Tool Hard and Soft Guarding
</ul>
