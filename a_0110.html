Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has increased reliability and reduced maintenance costs 
    at its compressor stations by employing handheld, barcode-reading personal 
    digital assistants (PDAs) to collect operating data from sensors not 
    connected to the company's SCADA system.</p>
    <p>The solution employs 
    a custom data collection application running on Palm OS devices with 
    integrated barcode scanners. Data collected with the application are 
    compliant with standard ODBC databases. The system provides PG&amp;E's pipeline 
    and compressor station overseers with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Redundant 
      monitoring of equipment and systems already wired into each compressor 
      station's local SCADA system </li>
      <li>Accurate and 
      economical &quot;manual&quot; monitoring of other critical data points that, for 
      various reasons, are not currently accessible to local station SCADA
      </li>
      <li>Truly interactive 
      communication between front-line operators / technicians and PG&amp;E's 
      corporate work management systems. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>PG&amp;E's eight 
    compressor stations in its California natural gas transmission pipeline 
    system are linked via SCADA to corporate engineering headquarters in San 
    Francisco. Most of the company's compressor stations are designed for 
    unmanned operation. Therefore, a continual and reliable stream of station 
    data to headquarters is critical for management of throughput, safety and 
    regulatory compliance.</p>
    <p><b>Data classes.</b> 
    Much of each station's operating information is acquired locally by GE Fanuc 
    CIMPLICITY HMI operator interface systems, while smaller data sets are 
    polled via microwave by the company's proprietary pipeline SCADA system. 
    Many of each station's other critical and semi-critical data points have 
    been too expensive to tie into the automated data-acquisition systems. This 
    could be because of the monitored equipment's age, inconvenient location, 
    lack of immediate criticality, or because it would be too difficult to &quot;tranducerize.&quot; 
    An example of difficult &quot;transducerizing&quot; would be using sensors to detect 
    preliminary leaking from any of the hundreds of gaskets on 10,000-hp 
    compressor engines. This would be virtually impossible. Finally, with the 
    ongoing infrastructure upgrades that the company continually implements, 
    hardwiring new instrumentation into a system that might soon be replaced, 
    eliminated, or moved doesn't make economic sense.</p>

    <p>For years PG&amp;E has 
    been using automated and manual data collection in both redundant and 
    complementary relationships. This was because running all information 
    through the SCADA system is impractical for reasons mentioned above, but 
    also because some of the data points in the automated system are producing 
    data so critical to life-safety and production, that the instrumentation 
    itself needs to be regularly inspected to ensure the data's validity.</p>
    <p>Also, physical 
    inspection by a qualified technician allows for the determination &mdash; and 
    immediate assessment &mdash; of irregular circumstances that initially might not 
    be detected by an automated data acquisition system. Such situations could 
    include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anomalistic 
      rotating shaft noises </li>
      <li>Severe weather 
      conditions </li>
      <li>Local seismic 
      events </li>
      <li>Nascent lubricant 
      leaks that could later bloom into environmental problems </li>
      <li>Local land erosion
      </li>
      <li>Degenerating 
      equipment conditions (rust, cracked meter lenses, disintegrating 
      electrical insulation, leaky gaskets). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Originally, PG&amp;E's 
    &quot;manual mode&quot; of inspection consisted of clipboards and hand-written entries 
    of data collected by observation of hundreds of instruments and meters 
    daily. This system &mdash; &quot;Clipboard-SCADA&quot; &mdash; had many drawbacks, not the least 
    being that once the data were collected, they still had to be transferred 
    via keyboard into local terminals on the utility's enterprise-wide SCADA 
    system. Not surprisingly, some of this information did not get entered. To 
    remedy the encoding bottleneck, PG&amp;E intermittently experimented with 
    hand-held electronic data acquisition systems. But due to ease-of-use and 
    training issues, each new technology was eventually abandoned in favor of a 
    return to clipboards and pencils &mdash; imperfect as they were.</p>
    <p><b>New system.</b> 
    PG&amp;E gas engineers asked DST Controls, a control system integrator, to 
    assist. Coincidentally, DST had just finished developing a Palm OS 
    application to help solve similar data-handling problems for a water 
    company. Like PG&amp;E, the water company also wanted to increase its data 
    acquisition system's functionality and flexibility but without the usual 
    costs associated with plant or enterprise-wide SCADA expansion.</p>
    <p>First step was 
    determining with PG&amp;E what operational aspects of the application were 
    important. After all, two other systems &mdash; clipboards and proprietary 
    handheld devices &mdash; had been tried and rejected. The following evolved as 
    primary concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance with 
      NEC Class I Div. II requirements (low voltage, no sparks) </li>
      <li>Simple operation 
      with minimal training </li>
      <li>Auto-rejection of 
      errant data entries (No more human errors manifesting themselves either as 
      out-of-range data for a specific instrument, or an accidental second 
      reading from the same instrument in a single shift) </li>
      <li>Automatic 
      identification of each instrument being read. (No more readings from meter 
      &quot;A&quot; being mistakenly attributed to meter &quot;B&quot;) </li>
      <li>Changes in 
      inspection routes and the addition or deletion of data points on the fly 
      had to be easily accommodated </li>
      <li>Auto-downloading 
      of data at the end of each shift into any of several data bases, for 
      example MS ACCESS, SQL Server, Oracle, ODBC-compliant data bases or 
      proprietary data bases. PG&amp;E needed this flexibility because of different 
      control and archiving system infrastructures at its different facilities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A technician on an 
    inspection route at some of PG&amp;E's compressor stations might manually record 
    as many as 500 pieces of data per day. Such data include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of starts 
      and total hours run by each compressor unit </li>
      <li>Compressor engine 
      oil pressure and temperature </li>
      <li>Oil filter 
      differential pressure </li>
      <li>Lubricating oil 
      level </li>
      <li>Air intake 
      differential pressure </li>
      <li>Compressor seal 
      oil differential pressure </li>
      <li>Unit fuel flow
      </li>
      <li>Ambient 
      temperature </li>
      <li>Fuel gas pressure
      </li>
      <li>Bearing vibration 
      readings </li>
      <li>Cooling water 
      level, pressure, and temperatures. </li>

    <p>To collect these and 
    other data with the new system, each piece of equipment to be monitored is 
    assigned a unique ID number within the station's local database. This task 
    was made easier by two years of instrumentation audits performed previously 
    in preparation for Y2K.</p>
    <p>Next, a barcode label 
    is generated by PG&amp;E staff and attached to the corresponding instrument. 
    Then, when a line inspector approaches a particular piece of equipment, he 
    scans the bar code label with the Palm OS device w/integrated barcode 
    scanner. For this application, Symbol Technology's industrially hardened 
    Model 1700 is used.</p>
    <p>If the equipment 
    being monitored doesn't have a barcode label, the device can still be 
    included manually in the handheld's inspection list to allow data readings 
    to be entered.</p>
    <p>Being able to scan 
    the barcode labels associated with specific equipment has helped PG&amp;E 
    technicians solve several problems with their earlier systems by eliminating 
    the potential human error of misidentifying the instrument being read and 
    providing appropriate data entry screens automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirmation of 
      the equipment's ID No., including textual description of the instrument to 
      truly confirm its identity for the operator </li>
      <li>Fill-in-the-boxes 
      template that is pre-configured for entry of the appropriate engineering 
      units, for example pounds per square inch, cubic feet per minute, gallons 
      per hour, number of duty cycles, for that piece of equipment </li>
      <li>The last reading 
      taken from the instrument </li>
      <li>&quot;Notes&quot; box for 
      optional textual notations regarding the instrument's condition
      </li>
      <li>&quot;Maint/Req&quot; check 
      box for automated maintenance action requests </li>
      <li>&quot;Maint Pending&quot; 
      field indicating when the next maintenance action is scheduled. (Data for 
      this field is obtained from PG&amp;E's work-management database.) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The new reading is 
    then entered via either of the two usual Palm data entry methods, such as 
    tapping selections into the Palm's pop-up keyboard with the unit's &quot;stylus,&quot; 
    or using &quot;Graffiti,&quot; Palm's proprietary calligraphic (handwriting) system. 
    Once the current reading and/or observation is entered, tapping &quot;Enter&quot; with 
    the stylus saves the record.</p>
    <p>At the end of the 
    shift, the operator replaces the Palm OS device in its cradle, which is 
    connected to a node (PC) on the station's network, and presses the 
    &quot;Synchronize&quot; button. This uploads the new data into the station database, 
    where it is archived until polled by PG&amp;E's corporate SCADA, usually via 
    microwave radio to corporate engineers in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>As required by PG&amp;E, 
    the application (now a commercial DST Controls product trademarked dBeHold) 
    also allows operators to define ranges of acceptable data. That is, it will 
    reject data that are out of range for a particular piece of equipment. This 
    alerts the technician to either re-enter his or her data or check the 
    instrument for malfunction</p>
    <p>The application also 
    allows supervisors to add, modify and delete user-access via passwords 
    protection.</p>
    <p><b>Implementation.
    </b>Besides providing daily &quot;system health&quot; information to PG&amp;E's 
    engineering staff, the new Palm OS-based system replaces obsolete systems 
    used with PG&amp;E's condition-based maintenance (CBM) program. CBM is a method 
    of managing equipment maintenance according to when the work is actually 
    required rather than on a strict time schedule. In a CBM program, it is 
    intended that equipment degradation be detected &mdash; and corrected &mdash; before 
    failure occurs. The hope is to avoid wasted time, effort and downtime fixing 
    things that &quot;aren't broke.&quot; </p>
    <p>In conjunction with 
    the CBM program, PG&amp;E still requires that some equipment be serviced on 
    regular time schedules. The company's pre-scheduled maintenance program is 
    referred to as the pipeline maintenance (PLM) program.</p>
    <p>In the PLM program, 
    certain pipeline assets are scheduled for regular maintenance on a time 
    basis, whereby a computer program automatically generates a work request for 
    equipment whenever the schedule requires.</p>
    <p>Compressors need 
    inspections every 2,000 hr and balancing every 500 hr. However, PLM only 
    triggers work requests when specific operating data are entered into the 
    system by an operator / technician. Before the new hand-held entry system, 
    operating data on each piece of equipment was taken by one operator using 
    paper, pencil and clipboard. The notes were then transcribed and entered 
    into the PLM computer program by another technician or clerk. </p>
    <p>The new Palm OS 
    system allows the data to be input directly from the technician to the PLM 
    program. Furthermore, information flows both directions. As the handheld is 
    synchronized with the PLM database, it also receives a download of 
    information regarding the scheduled maintenance for each piece of equipment, 
    even if the maintenance was scheduled by someone else through a personal 
    computer back at headquarters. This means that the operator in the field now 
    has an interactive and bi-directional way to initiate and track work 
    requests for each piece of equipment he or she monitors.</p>
    <p>To illustrate, a 
    compressor unit's engine-hour reading taken during a manual inspection 
    provides the best assurance of accurate reading (no possibility of errors 
    from automated readings) and is then downloaded directly &mdash; via the Palm OS 
    device &mdash; to the database servicing PLM.</p>
    <p>When PLM determines 
    by the readings that an inspection or overhaul is required, a work request 
    is automatically generated, printed and downloaded to the handheld device of 
    the appropriate maintenance personnel. This further reduces the likelihood 
    of human error in manual transcription or verbal work orders. Here is 
    another capability. During the manual inspection done on each shift, if the 
    operator determines a condition exists that requires immediate attention, he 
    or she simply taps in a check-box on the handheld's data-entry screen 
    associated with that piece of equipment. Then, when synchronized with the 
    database, PLM will automatically generate a work request based solely on 
    that operator's independent judgment.
