In addition to working closely with our control engineers on automation projects, DST's staff of electrical engineers is also ready to provide "standalone" electrical engineering services for applications such as building & facility management systems and power distribution for industrial equipment and systems. 
<br><br>
DST's electrical designers regularly provide IEEE standard drawings in any of several different formats.  Our department specialists are equally expert in the use of AutoCad, Micro Station, and Solid Works. No matter what our clients' design platform, their drawings can always be saved in .dxf format for universal importing.  Our designers are proud of the speed and precision that they exhibit in delivering our clients' designs on-time&mdash;and right&mdash;the first time.
