We can build solely to customer specifications or, with our engineering department, turn-key a project from conceptualization to installation.<p>If a customer's system or sub-system is already complete engineering-wise and ready to be assembled by the tens, hundreds, or thousands, we stand ready to build, test, and deliver each and every one of those units: on-spec, on-budget, and most importantly, on-schedule.<p>And if there's still room for product improvement, such as optimization for manufacturability, component-cost reduction, functional enhancement, or standards compliance &#45; our engineering group can do that too.<p><span class="bolder">To summarize:</span> We help our domestic and overseas customers optimize existing products, as well as develop new ones.

This can be as simple as assembling a few wiring harnesses for a microscopic x-ray system or as complicated as designing, building, programming, and servicing over a thousand PLC & HMI based controllers that regulate the delivery of specialty gasses to production tools.<p>OSM's big value to DST's customers is lower cost with higher quality and faster delivery so the OEM can concentrate on improving its products and satisfying its customers.<p>For our OEM offers to the Solar and other CleanTech industries, check out our solar website at &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dst-solar.com">www.dst-solar.com</a></div>

Cost-cutting tactics used by our experienced and tough-minded purchasing people include supplier pricing alliances, volume purchasing leverage, and web-based RFQ & order entry. Coupled with a contemporary globalized procurement philosophy that makes lowering costs their "Prime Directive," DST-Procurement uses these tools to ensure the highest quality components, at the lowest possible cost, delivered in the shortest time possible.</div>
