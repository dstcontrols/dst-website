        <div class="proxima14 bodyTweak">In addition to UL 508A, our Panel and Sub-assembly shop is…
          <ul>
            <li>Certified to build to the UL-1741 and UL-67 standards</li>
            <li>Experienced in intrinsically-safe applications</li>
            <li>Able to comply with &#45; and produce documentation packages for &#45; CE, CSA, SEMI, and IP-20 standards</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We can build solely to customer specifications or, with our engineering department, turn-key a project from conceptualization to installation.
            <p>If a customer's system or sub-system is already complete engineering-wise and ready to be assembled by the tens, hundreds, or thousands, we stand ready to build, test, and deliver each and every one of those units: on-spec, on-budget, and
              most importantly, on-schedule.
              <p>And if there's still room for product improvement, such as optimization for manufacturability, component-cost reduction, functional enhancement, or standards compliance &#45; our engineering group can do that too.
                <p>
                  <span class="bolder">To summarize:</span> We help our domestic and overseas customers optimize existing products, as well as develop new ones. Then we build those products in commercial volumes, to ISO quality standards, at globally-competitive costs.</div>

        <div class="proxima14 bodyTweak">DST's Outsourced Subsystem Manufacturing or OSM (pronounced "Awesome") group specializes in higher-volume production of electrical or electronic-based subsystems. This can be as simple as assembling a few wiring harnesses for a microscopic x-ray
          system or as complicated as designing, building, programming, and servicing over a thousand PLC & HMI based controllers that regulate the delivery of specialty gasses to production tools.
          <p>OSM's big value to DST's customers is lower cost with higher quality and faster delivery so the OEM can concentrate on improving its products and satisfying its customers.
            <p>For our OEM offers to the Solar and other CleanTech industries, check out our solar website at &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dst-solar.com">www.dst-solar.com</a>

        <div class="proxima14 bodyTweak">Serving both DST's custom panel shop and OSM group, our Procurement Department actually operates as a profit-center for our customers. Cost-cutting tactics used by our experienced and tough-minded purchasing people include supplier pricing alliances,
          volume purchasing leverage, and web-based RFQ & order entry. Coupled with a contemporary globalized procurement philosophy that makes lowering costs their "Prime Directive," DST-Procurement uses these tools to ensure the highest quality components,
          at the lowest possible cost, delivered in the shortest time possible.</div>
