      <P><B>T</B>he southern tip of California's Marin county is separated from the 
      city of San Francisco by the most famous mile-long strip of steel and 
      concrete in the world. Yet, within a 10-minute walk of the Golden Gate's 
      Marin terminus begins a county-wide network of California Wildlife Service 
      signs warning against mountain lion attacks. Marin county's geography is 
      rugged! </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Precipitous hills covered with dense scrub growth and 
      isolated population centers typify this picturesque but geologically lumpy 
      and unstable part of the world. And it is here--with an advanced 
      supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system that would even 
      make the Mir astronauts sleep more soundly--that the Marin Municipal Water 
      District (MMWD, Corte Madera, Calif.) now reliably provides its client 
      population of 180,000 with potable water. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the implementation of the new SCADA system, MMWD's 
      104 pumping stations, 139 storage tanks (ranging in size from 20,000 to 
      5,000,000 gal.), and myriad control valves scattered across the district's 
      147sq miles were largely monitored only by scheduled inspections or 
      "emergencies"--such as gushing ruptured mains, land erosion from tank or 
      reservoir overflow, and customer complaints of having no water. Mechanical 
      failures and aging infrastructure were aggravated by occasional excessive 
      rains, often accompanied by mud slides and earthquakes, and by a poorly 
      performing system control. </P>
      <P><IMG SRC="../images/xwindows.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=220 ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;&nbsp;MMWD's previous control system had evolved since the 
      1960's, and consisted of tone-telemetry system that used leased telephone 
      lines to allow the district to remotely monitor tank levels using 
      pulse-duration signals and start pumps using discrete signals. Initially, 
      the manual start/stop pump system automatically controlled each pump 
      station based on tank levels. The original computer system occupied three 
      6-ft high, 19-in racks with a "whopping"64K memory. To increase 
      reliability and facilitate service, this computer was soon replaced with a 
      system of programmable logic controllers that duplicated the computer's 
      functions. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;MMWD experimented with installing remote PLCs at a few 
      pump/tank facilities that communicated digitally back to the master PLC. 
      However, the excessive cost of leased lines and high equipment failure 
      rate soon overcame any gains from the evolved control system. The old 
      system's maintenance still relied heavily on scheduled visits and "field 
      alarms"(i.e., phone calls from irate customers). The necessity to 
      accurately control and document system performance provided motivation for 
      MMWD to implement the state-of-the-art SCADA system now in place. </P>
      <P><B>Work begins</B> </P>
      <P><IMG SRC="../images/bill.jpg" WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=218 ALIGN=LEFT>Although the new system's control philosophy was simple (provide 
      control of the booster pumps that lift water to hilltop storage tanks as 
      needed), system integration was not. In addition to the new hardware and 
      software installation, MMWD also saw the opportunity to develop new 
      control strategies to fine tune water system operation. See accompanying 
      sidebar. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The new SCADA system, based on UNIX-based OASyS software, 
      version 6.0, developed by Valmet Automation (Houston, Tex.), runs on a DEC 
      Alpha computer. The software incorporates object-based programming and 
      three-dimensional data visualization. MMWD built and linked its displays 
      from AutoCAD files and, more importantly in this installation, included 
      drawing formats of geographical information system vendors. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The human-machine interface console consists of four CRT 
      displays and an overhead projector. These devices provide a look into the 
      system that monitors and controls 6,000 "hard" and "soft" I/O points 
      spread over 200 remote tank/pump sites and 174 remote terminal units 
      (RTUs). MMWD uses a PC node for the PLC ladder-logic software. Control 
      executions from the command site include both pump mode and setpoint 
      changes. Data such as tank levels, system flow rates and pressures, and 
      alarm events are stored on the system's hard drive for up to 6 months 
      before being archived to a CD-ROM disk. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Power for all sites needing monitoring was not always 
      readily available. Approximately 20 MMWD water storage tanks were remote 
      enough to require a solar-powered electrical supply with battery-backup 
      for radio modems and on-site RTUs. Despite the rugged terrain, the 
      remaining sites have utility power. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;MMWD's system uses low-cost Schneider Automation (North 
      Andover, Mass.) "Micro" 612 PLCs as remote terminal units at each site. 
      These incorporate 56 kbit/sec, digital lease-line modems, and 9.6 kbit/sec 
      digital radios. MMWD has its own frequency for radio communications, using 
      MDS radios with multiple address 900 MHz for data only. In cases where a 
      line of sight does not exist between controlled pump/tank installation and 
      one of the radio system's three repeater stations, leased digital 
      telephone lines are used. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to handling MMWD's water transmission and 
      distribution, the new system also monitors four water-treatment plants. 
      Controlled and monitored by similar "smart" hardware, the plants are fully 
      integrated into the water district's operational control system, enhancing 
      operation of the entire water distribution system. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Project implementation was facilitated through teamwork 
      between MMWD and its prime contractor, Valmet Automation's Calgary, Canada 
      office. Cal Tech Controls (Livermore, Calif.) and DST Controls (Benicia, 
      Calif.) provided project management, hardware fabrication and integration, 
      and back-up service for the HMI and RTU portions of the project. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear winners in this upgrade have been MMWD's 
      customers. Improving system control provides both uninterrupted water 
      service and system flexibility to respond more quickly in case of a 
      malfunction. </P>
      <HR>

      <H2 align=center><B>New Control Strategies</B> </H2>
      <P>As part of the SCADA system implementation, Marin Municipal Water 
      District (MMWD) took a closer look at its control strategies. Along with 
      equipment and software upgrades, it was decided some new strategies were 
      in order. Included as a result of the upgrade was closed-loop control on 
      valves, alternate control-mode capability for pump stations, optimum pump 
      selection, and pressure surge data collection. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Key control valve loops within the system were modified to 
      allow local closed-loop control. An operator can enter criteria governing 
      local control conditions via the central console. Flow and/or pressure 
      parameters are then downloaded to the RTU at the pump or reservoir 
      station. Control valves can then be reconfigured for either rate-of-flow 
      or pressure-based control by the click of a mouse. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;MMWD was also concerned that, because the new system was 
      centrally controlled, it may have communication problems with pump lift 
      systems during the winter storm season. For the system to function 
      properly, the SCADA system must communicate with the pump and its 
      receiving tank. To solve this problem, an RTU subroutine known as 
      Alternate Control Mode (ACM), was developed. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If communication is lost with either the pump or its 
      receiving tank, the ACM subroutine would be automatically initiated after 
      a predetermined period of time. Once in this mode, the RTU will not 
      restart the pump until its discharge pressure drops to a preset value. 
      Once restarted, the pump will only deliver a preset volume of water. This 
      process will continue until communication has been restored and regular 
      operation can be resumed. </P>
      <P><B>Pump selection/data collection</B> </P>
      <P>In addition to monitoring and controlling "time-of-day" pump-motor 
      energy use, additional savings were obtained by programming the RTUs to 
      run the most efficient pump--there are several in each stations--based on 
      capacity required. High demand conditions automatically switch pump 
      operation to the unit that can efficiently meet the volume requirement. 
      </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to more tightly monitor pressure surges in the 
      system, MMWD needed to retrieve finer resolution data than could be 
      provided by the system's 15-sec scan time. To facilitate retrieving high 
      resolution data from this sprawling control system, the user resorted to 
      some "creative" PLC programming. The solution was to take the PLC 
      registers and place them in a "rolling table" (FIFO) configuration with a 
      time difference between each register as low as 10 msec. Once a pressure 
      surge occurred, the registers were frozen at their the pre-event data 
      content. At this time, the PLC starts to fill an additional register with 
      post-event data. Once this table fills, all 200 registers are downloaded 
      to the SCADA system. </P><BR><BR></FONT>
