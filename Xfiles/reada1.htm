      bio-solids, and sewage: "A rose by any other name..."--it's a sure thing
      that such technical euphemisms for this nettlesome by-product of
      civilization were farthest from The Bard's mind when he penned his most
      famous floral reference.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P align=left><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>But today, the treatment,
      transportation, and disposal of municipal waste never is far from the
      minds of those entrusted with keeping our environs clean and safe.
      Regarding same, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) sewage
      treatment plant for Oakland, Calif., was facing a possible "throughput
      problem." That is, after the sewage was treated in the district's
      multi-step digester system and dewatering centrifuge, the resulting cake
      or sludge had to be quickly loaded into container trucks for
      transportation to the district's customers. Otherwise, "inventory" might
      accumulate. (Yes, there are customers for everything, even sludge. More
      than 120,000 lb per day of Oakland's municipal by-product is purchased by
      fertilizer manufacturers.)</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><SMALL>A messy
      problem</SMALL></STRONG><BR><BR><SMALL>To keep up with supply, each truck
      transporting sludge from the treatment plant to the fertilizer plant had
      to be loaded with as much as 50,000 lb of sludge in about three minutes.
      This had to be done within a tolerance of ±1% because the city had to
      charge its customers correctly and, as with any hazardous material, keep
      certified records of how much went where. Furthermore, the system also had
      to have a price tag in line with today's lean municipal budgets, thus
      producing the classic engineering conundrum for the solution providers:
      "You want a system that's fast, accurate, and cheap? Pick any
      two."</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The most difficult obstacle to
      overcome in the process was filling the trucks quickly with ±1% accuracy
      regardless of large fluctuations in the sludge's flow rates. These
      "unmodelable" fluctuations were caused by viscosity changes due to batch
      variants in sludge dehydration and temperature, and varying material
      heights (i.e. head pressure) in the loading hoppers. Unlike the constant
      relationship between head pressure and flow rates when dealing with
      liquids, municipal sludge has varying densities and flow rates ranging
      from that of dirt to thick soup.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The next most serious problem to
      overcome was measuring real-time load-out status because the programmable
      logic controller (PLC) would have no direct feedback indicating same. This

      Rafael, Calif.), devised a hopper slide gate system to handle the
      mechanics of this nasty dynamic control problem with speed, accuracy, and
      budget in mind. MSE's system also had to have an expected life span of at
      least 15 years.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>To leverage the control system's
      capabilities, MSE uses a Diamond Seal slide gate with a diamond-shaped
      orifice allowing full-bore flow rates to be quickly followed by tightly
      metered low-flow rates. This is because the design's diamond-shaped
      opening decreases and increases in size much more quickly than rectangular
      configurations with similar actuator stroke lengths.</SMALL></FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>In automatic mode the load-out
      operator enters, via the touchpad, truck and customer identification
      information and intended load weights. The touchpad inputs this
      information to the PLC where it is integrated to effect slide-gate
      operation. On initiation of the load-out cycle from the PLC, the slide
      gate moves to its full open, or "course," position and initiates flow.
      When 70% of the desired load is reached (approx. 35,000 lb in about 2
      min), the PLC moves the gate to an "intermediate" position until 95% of
      load-out is reached. The gate then closes to the "fine" position until
      100% of the load-out weight (approx. 50,000 lb) has been completed. The
      PLC then closes the gate, terminating load-out all in about three minutes
      total.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The PLC determines gate positioning
      as a function of the current weight of sludge loaded to the truck. This
      real-time loaded-out weight is calculated from hopper weight measurements
      and sludge flow into hoppers. These two measurements are scanned by the
      PLC every second to maintain an accurate accounting of sludge loaded into
      the truck.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>When the operator initiates the
      load-out sequence, the PLC takes a snapshot of the hopper weight at the
      beginning of the sequence (i.e., hopper tare weight). The current total
      hopper weight is continuously monitored as sludge is loaded into the
      trucks. The net weight loaded into a truck at any given time is the
      initial hopper (tare) weight minus the current hopper weight, plus the
      totalized sludge flow into the hopper from the centrifuges since that
      load-out began. Magnetic flowmeters at the centrifuge provide sludge-flow
      amounts to the PLC.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The loaded-out net weight is then
      used by the Modicon PLC for execution of its three primary control
      functions:</SMALL></FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Slide gates are actuated by
      hydraulic cylinders controlled by the PLC and monitored by position
      sensors which serve as inputs to the PLC.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>To determine tare and current hopper
      weights, each hopper is mounted on four K-M load cells, one under each
      corner. The gross weight measurement is accurate to 0.1% of span (0-75,000
      lb). The weight measurement system subtracts the hopper tare weight from
      the actual hopper weight to determine the net sludge weight in the hopper
      at any time.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>As suggested, the system not only
      has to load each truck quickly, accurately and economically but also
      evenly. If a single 50,000 lb mound of "product" were piled in one part of
      the truck, vehicle handling would be adversely effected and "free samples"
      could be blown off the top of the cone as the truck speeds to its
      destination, upsetting neighbors and regulators alike. Hence, each loading
      platform consists of three overhead loading hoppers to evenly deposit the
      loads in the trucks.</SMALL></FONT></P>

            src="../images/billrich.gif" width=300 align=left><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><SMALL>Optimizing the
      process</SMALL></STRONG><BR><SMALL>Besides loading trucks properly, the
      PLC must also keep each hopper sufficiently refilled to maintain loading
      efficency. It does this by using hopper net-weight status to actuate the
      12 valve system that modulates sludge transfer from the centrifugal
      dehydrators to the loading hoppers. The hoppers are alternately filled to
      a predetermined differential weight as compared to each
      other.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The hopper with the lowest weight is
      refilled first. When that hopper's net sludge weight exceeds the
      differential, as compared to the previous highest hopper weight, the
      filling sequence is redirected to the new lowest weight hopper and the
      cycle continues until all three hoppers are full.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>The load-out operator can control
      the loading of sludge from the hoppers into trucks automatically or
      manually from the touchpad station. In either case, the screen displays
      net hopper weights, load out status, and customer identification
      information.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>To perform a manual load-out, the
      operator turns a position switch wired to the PLC to effect the degree of
      gate-open desired. Needless to say, care must be taken when exercising
      control in this mode.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>Upon load-out completion, a State of
      California Department of Transportation-required bill of lading with truck
      identification and load-out weight is printed by the system. The bill of
      lading is then handed to the driver and checked for accuracy at an
      independent truck scale by district personnel before leaving the
      pant.</SMALL></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><SMALL>During original system calibration,
      the loadout weight was periodically compared to a set of certified truck
      scales. To date, the agreement between the truck scales and the weight
      reported by the PLC has been consistently within 0.5%. This means trucks
      keep rolling out from under loading gates fast enough to spare Oakland
      that mother of all municipal waste problems--"accumulated
      inventory."</SMALL></FONT></P>
