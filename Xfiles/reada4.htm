            <P><B>Question: </B>Team the world's most accurate instrumentation 
            with the world's most powerful controllers and what do you have? 
</P>
            <P><B>Answer: </B>Not much. (Unless, of course, they're properly 
            connected via a suitably fast, noise-free communication medium.) 
</P>
            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Wire and cable, and more recently, optical 
            fibers andeven wireless networks are the oft-neglected backbone of 
            industrial control. And whether the application is discrete, batch, 
            or process, bus-based or conventional analog, the same basic 
            questions must be answered, says Neil Maffett,a senior principal 
            engineer with Babcock and Wilcox,Lynchburg, Va. "A system integrator 
            must deal with thesame basic wiring techniques," he says. </P>
            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The questions start with application 
            specifics:<B> </B>How fast<B> </B>do signals need to be sent? What 
            are potential sources of electrical noise? Will physical connections 
            require insulation with special chemical resistance? Is there 
            existing wiring that can be reused? </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the chosen media--whether copper, fiber, or 
            wireless--must be properly installed and maintained. Adherence to 
            applicable codes and good engineering practice are key, according to 
            Gary Coleman, production manager for Controllink Inc., an Algonquin, 
            Ill.-based system integrator. General installation guidelines 
            include adherence to Joint Industry Council (JIC) standards, the 
            National Electric Code (NEC), as well as local codes, agrees 
            B&amp;W's Mr. Maffett. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrofit applications with existing and perhaps 
            reusable wiring bring with them both opportunities for cost savings 
            and potential complications. "Do not trust existing documentation," 
            Mr. Maffett cautions. "Verify and document the installation before 
            starting any upgrade or expansion work," he adds. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But in many cases, existing wiring--even up to 25 
            years old---can be retained, says Bill Southard, president of DST 
            Controls, Benicia, Calif. In these situations, however, good 
            engineering practice dictates that its integrity (both functional 
            and physical) be verified. A thorough check of existing wiring can 
            often eliminate need for removal and replacement. This also helps 
            eliminate the possibility of introducing an error into a properly 
            functioning system. "Surprises always cost money," Mr. Southard 
            says. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And while a lot of attention has been lavished (and 
            media ink spilled) on the use of fieldbuses and device-level 
            networks, not all users are rushing aboard. "Bus-based control 
            installations have not been a priority with our customers," says 
            Controllink's Mr. Coleman. "As a matter of fact, all of our current 
            projects involve discrete wiring. And, we do not see any bus 
            projects on the horizon," he states. "The companies we do business 
            with are going with tried-and-true analog technology at this time." 
            </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, about 10% of system integrator DST 
            Controls' installations are embracing bus technology. While there 
            has been much interest shown by DST's client base, the technology 
            has proven to be either too new or too unproven for most, Mr. 
            Southard says. Although many users and system integrators would like 
            to gain experience in applying device-level networks, short 
            installation schedules and risk-aversion have been limiting factors. 
            </P>
            <P><B>Copper, optics, or no wires at all?</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>Which medium is used will depends 
            directly on the application. Choices include metal wire (usually 
            copper), fiber optics, and wireless technologies (e.g., infrared 
            broadcast, radio frequency, and power line carrier transmission--see 
            sidebar, "Where Wires Fear to Tread"). Each has its virtues and 
            weaknesses. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most users and integrators feel at home 
            using standard wire and cable, fiber optics is becoming more 
            prevalent. Intrinsic immunity to electrical noise is a key selling 
            point. Easier and more reliable field splices/termination of 
            fiber-optic cables is also driving their use in industrial 
            applications. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much of the wire and cable available today 
            competes very well with fiber optics in many areas. Insulation and 
            shielding are now available to handle a full range of environmental 
            concerns including temperature extremes, moisture and humidity, 
            elevated pressures, all manner of radio-frequency and 
            electromagnetic interference (RFI/EMI), as well as physical abuse 
            from shock, vibration, and flexure. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For wire or fiber, choice of jacket material should 
            take into account any chemicals likely to be encountered in the 
            application. Hostile agents can be drawn into the jacketing (causing 
            it to "balloon," soften, and ultimately disintegrate) or draw 
            chemicals from the jacketing material, causing it to become brittle. 
            Specialty jacketing also is available, such as UV-resistant 
            communication cable or hydrocarbon-resistant insulation for wire 
            that must share a transfer line with grease. </P>
            <P><B>Wire alternatives</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>Only a few years ago, picking wire 
            was simple. There was either control or power wiring. Even the line 
            dividing them was very soft, since in a 115 V ac control 
            environment, control signals were sometimes strong enough to provide 
            power. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the needs of industry have changed. The 
            proliferation of machining centers and robots demanded more flexible 
            (literally) wires and cables. Also, the move to 24 V dc control 
            systems required smaller-gage wire and shielded control wires. These 
            conditions created a new wire product group, electronic wires. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another group of wire products evolved when 
            fieldbus technology came into play. "When wiring a plant, it's now 
            necessary to consider all of the wire categories and how they 
            interact," says Udo Lutze, president of wire manufacturer Lutze, 
            Inc. in Charlotte, N.C. Wires, other than those specialized 
            instrumentation wires (e.g., thermocouple leads) are categorized by 
            Mr. Lutze into five groups: </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Power wires: High-amperage large gage wires against which 
              instrumentation and data transmission wires may need to be 
              shielded; 
              <LI>Control wires: Medium gage wires used to carry 115 V ac or 24 
              V dc control signals (possibly shielded); 
              <LI>Robotic wires: Highly flexible wires designed for constant 
              motion in C-tracks or wire carriers; 
              <LI>Electronic wires: Low-voltage wires that normally are 
              shielded; and, 
              <LI>Fieldbus wires: Shielded wires and cables designed to protect 
              and transmit high-bandwidth control signals. </LI></UL>
            <P><B>Can't keep a good LAN down</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>"As the bandwidth requirements 
            increase, users are looking to fiber technology as the solution." 
            says engineer Eric Bulington, at Belden Wire &amp; Cable Co., 
            Richmond, Ind. "Fiber is becoming the choice because of its 
            versatile construction types and variety of installation 
            possibilities." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three popular myths about fiber-optic 
            cables that traditionally have kept them from wider application: 
</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Myth: Fiber is fragile. Reality: Today's optical cables offer 
              greater tensile strength than copper or steel wires of the same 
              diameter. 
              <LI>Myth: Fiber is hard to work with. Reality: While not as 
              straightforward as wire connections, today's fiber connections 
              require fewer parts, and the tools and techniques have evolved to 
              make terminating fiber optics easier and less time-consuming. 
              <LI>Myth: Fiber is expensive. Reality: For the past several years, 
              fiber-optic cable and related components have been comparably 
              priced to their copper-wire counterparts. </LI></UL>
            <P><B>Carrier and conduit alternatives</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>When it comes time to actually 
            install the selected communication medium, adherence to applicable 
            codes and good engineering practice become primary. Basic techniques 
            often vary by geographic region, says Controllink's Mr. Coleman. For 
            example, installations in the Northern U.S. tend to use mostly 
            conduit wireways, whereas installations in the milder Southern 
            climates usually combine cable trays with conduit drops. In addition 
            to carrier selection, segregation of power from instrumentation 
            wiring and proper grounding must also be considered. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wire and fiber-optic cables are pulled through a 
            variety of mechanical carriers. These include conduit, cable trays, 
            raceways, and cable carriers. Also, bus bars are often used to 
            simplify wiring in enclosures and panels. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't pull many wires through conduit, so it has 
            limited applicability in many industrial situations. When pulling 
            wires in conduit, three different configurations of the wires can 
            occur--triangular, cradled, and jammed. Certain ratios of cable 
            diameter to conduit diameter are more likely to cause problems. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable trays allow many cables to be pulled in the 
            same general area and at different times. Concerns include: 
            correctly calculated data and adherence to the design limits of the 
            cables being installed with respect to tensions, sidewall pressures, 
            and minimum bending radii. Damage occurs most frequently as a result 
            of improper handling before or during installation, or inadequate 
            protection after installation. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Raceways are basically covered cable trays. In cable 
            trays, cables can be piled on top of each other with little or no 
            concern about stacking height. This is not true with raceways. As in 
            conduit, there's only so much cross sectional space available. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable carriers are flexible, and play an important 
            role in prolonging the life of moving cables. Installing them may 
            seem straightforward, but follow manufacturers' data sheets or 
            catalogs carefully. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained by Greg Binder, senior product marketing 
            engineer, Rockwell Automation/Allen-Bradley Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.), 
            bus bars are metal bars that provide structural support and line 
            side electrical power to motor control components, reducing the 
            number of wires, holes, and mounting screws. Components can be added 
            and removed without extensive rewiring, reducing maintenance costs 
            throughout the life of the control system. </P>
            <P><B>Shield against noise, ground only once</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>Wires and cables should also be 
            routed in such a way as to minimize EMI/RFI. Potential sources of 
            data-disrupting noise include electric arc welders, heaters, motors, 
            power relays/contactors, and high-voltage power lines. Some cables 
            themselves create electrical noise while others are susceptible to 
            it. Fieldbus and other control and data carrying cables should be 
            protected against power cables. Shielding helps, but ideally power 
            and data cables should be run in different locations; separate 
            control and power and you're safe. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where conductors must cross, they 
            should be fixed by clamps or cable ties at 90° to each other to 
            minimize electrical interference caused by the magnetic flux. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because no shielding is 100% effective, filtering is 
            becoming commonplace," cautions Bill Mango, national sales manager 
            of connectors for Richard Hirschmann of America, Inc. (Riverdale, 
            N.J.). Thus, Mr. Mango explains, Hirschmann is getting more requests 
            for connector products to include built-in filters. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Improper grounding is another potential source of 
            data transmission problems. "Signal wires have the potential for 
            being grounded in more than one location," says Dave Brooks, vp of 
            marketing, Weidmüller (Latham, N.Y.). "Typically, signal wires are 
            grounded at only one location, usually at the input to the bus 
            system. However, this is not always possible. If the ground at the 
            transmitter is different from the ground at the bus system, there is 
            a potential for a 'ground loop.' Because ground is used as a 
            reference point for the signal, problems with accuracy can develop. 
            If there are different grounds, there are different reference 
            points." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation of different grounds can be achieved with 
            isolators, which break the continuity of the loop while isolating 
            the grounds. Signal isolators in the same housing as terminal blocks 
            provide separation without taking up additional space. </P>
            <P><B>A careful pull avoids damage</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>When it comes time to actually pull 
            your carefully specified wire or cable, proper handling and planning 
            can prevent problems. Indeed, many failures of low-voltage cables 
            have their roots in damage incurred during installation, says 
            Michael Kopchik, Jr., senior technical consultant, Rome Cable Corp. 
            (Rome, N.Y.). "This damage is usually attributed to improper 
            cable-handling procedures or improper design of the conduit or other 
            raceway system. However, the damage is not always immediately 
            apparent. Undetected, it could result in cable failure months or 
            years after installation. At this point, replacement is usually 
            difficult, prolonged, and quite costly." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some advance preparation also can help. "Make sure 
            there are no twists, bends, or kinks in the cable," recommends 
            Gerald Pochurek, director of engineering, Olflex Wire &amp; Cable, 
            Inc. (Fairfield, N.J.). "Lay the cable out for one to two hours 
            before installation to dissipate any stress remaining from cable 
            storage." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although rough and improper handling during the 
            pull-in process is often attributed to carelessness, much results 
            from ignorance and inexperience. Adhering to a few basic 
            installation guidelines greatly reduces the potential for damage 
            during the pull: </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Follow manufacturer's guidelines regarding allowable sizes and 
              conductors materials, allowable tension, and number of bends, etc. 
              <BR>
              <LI>Let the cable warm up. Insulation and jacketing lose 
              flexibility and becomebrittle in cold weather. In colder 
              environments, cables should be stored in awarm location for at 
              least 24 hrs before installation.<BR>
              <LI>Clean the conduit/raceway/cable tray before beginning the 
              pull. Waste materials frequently cause physical damage when cables 
              are pulled in. Waste removal can be done by pulling a mandrel or 
              plug through the conduit, while checking at each opening along the 
              route and removing any foreign matter dislodged at condulets or 
              pullboxes. Pulling a clean cloth/swab to wipe out any remaining 
              debris complete the procedure.<BR>
              <LI>When pulling multiple cables, the pulling eye or basket should 
              be equipped with a swivel. Free rotation is vital to accommodate 
              the unequal tensions created by multiple cables.<BR>
              <LI>Use steel lines only in steel raceways. A stranded steel line 
              can saw into aluminum or nonmetallic raceways at bends along the 
              route, leaving sharp edges that can damage the cable. Manila hemp 
              or a synthetic fiber rope that doesn't stretch is best for pulling 
              in nonsteel conduit. Don't use materials such as nylon for pull 
              lines because they stretch, resulting in uneven pulling tension 
              and erratic cable surges.<BR>
              <LI>Lubricate, lubricate, lubricate. An approved lubricant should 
              be applied continuously and liberally throughout the pulling 
              process to reduce friction between the cable jacket and cable 
              tray. For long or difficult pulls, lubricant should also be 
              applied to the in-side of the raceway at all accessible points 
              throughout the pull, such as con-duit bodies.<BR>
              <LI>Plan twice, pull once. The pull should be planned so that a 
              continuous, nonstop pulling rate is maintained. Stopping in 
              mid-pull should be avoided. On long, difficult pulls, use a 
              two-way radios to communicate between the feed and pulling points. 
              </LI></UL>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, once the wire or cable pull is complete, 
            don't neglect the importance of proper connections, cautions Hans 
            Buhler, P.E., a senior electrical engineer with Power Engineers Inc. 
            (Hadley, Ida.). "Do not overlook wire and cable termination. 
            Properly specified provisions for stress relief at the terminations 
            are important. Most failures on wiring and cabling systems take 
            place at termination points," he says. Likewise, positive grounding 
            must be ensured at the termination point. Remember, shielding is 
            useless if not grounded: a wire that comes loose is no use at all.

            Because virtually all versions of the fieldbus concept's physical 
            layer already are specified in the ISA's SP50 standard, Bob Crowder, 
            president of Ship Star Associates (Newark, Del.), suggests the 
            following test to determine the suitability of your old wire: </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect the wires into a "chicken foot" at the 
            junction box and install terminators (100 {OMEGA} ±1% resistor in 
            series with a nonpolarized 2 µF ±20% 50 V working voltage 
            capacitor). Direct current leakage through the terminator should be 
            less than or equal to 100 µA and the terminator should be 
            nonpolarized. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use an impedance tester to verify 100{OMEGA} ±20% 
            over the frequency range from 8 to 50 kHz. (SP50 calls for a maximum 
            dc resistance of 22 {OMEGA}/km at 25 °C.) </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the existing wiring is within the above 
            specifications, Mr. Crowder is confident that it shouldn't have to

            computer-aided drafting (CAD) package to execute electrical 
            schematics? Want to have more fun on the job? Deliver more accurate 
            work in less time? Well, it may be time to go beyond generic CAD in 
            favor of a software package specifically designed to help streamline 
            electrical schematic development. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"AutoCAD itself is not made for what we do," explains 
            John Holland, a project engineer for system integrator and panel 
            builder K&amp;R Automation Corp., Warren, Mich. AutoCAD, from San 
            Rafael, Calif.-based Autodesk, is the industry standard mechanical 
            CAD package for PCs. "It's a great drawing package, but it doesn't 
            help you think," says Mr. Holland. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of using AutoCAD alone, K&amp;R uses 
            Promis-e, anAutoCAD add-on package from ECT International 
            (Brookfield, Wis.), that customizes AutoCAD's primitive mechanical 
            drawing strengths (lines, arcs, etc.) to the needs of electrical 
            controls designers. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes our jobs much more interesting," says Mr. 
            Holland, who once spent an entire year error-checking the schematics 
            for an automated conveyor system--a task that is now performed 
            automatically as designs are developed. "The software does the 
            things that everybody hates to do. Plus, accuracy and consistency go 
            way up," he remarks. </P>
            <P><B>Beyond mechanical CAD</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>So just what do these packages do 
            that AutoCAD doesn't? First and most obvious are the built-in tools 
            designed to make drawing electrical schematics easier. Libraries of 
            icons represent electrical control entities as well as specific 
            vendors' parts. "We had to keep log books of parts, but now we just 
            let the software do that," says Jeff Shellenberger, electrical 
            designer and system administrator for IPEC/Planar, a Phoenix, 
            Ariz.-based builder of semiconductor processing machines. 
            Drag-and-drop, snap-to connections are automatically assumed to be 
            wires and numbered accordingly. Estimates of savings in drawing time 
            alone range from 15% for sophisticated AutoCAD users to as high as 
            70% for the uninitiated. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond drawing time, the real payoff comes in taking 
            advantage of the design data that underlies the schematic. 
            "Electrical controls design is not about pictures, its about 
            information," says Steve Bernier, an applications engineer with 
            EPLAN/Wiechers &amp; Partner, a software developer that markets a 
            standalone (AutoCAD independent) package from its offices in 
            Brookfield, Wis. "A circle with a line on each side may represent a 
            coil, but that coil has a manufacturer, a part number, contactor 
            cross references, and connecting wire information that CAD packages 
            do not capture," he says. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real productivity comes from the extraction of 
            information from those drawings," adds Jamie Howe, marketing manager 
            for VIA Development Corp., a schematic software developer based in 
            Marion, Ind. VIA user Sherry Wolfe, a supervising design engineer at 
            Armstrong World Industries, Lancaster, Pa., concurs, identifying 
            "automatic extraction of reports such as a bill of materials" as the 
            software's key benefit. "We can extract data from any drawing that 
            has attributes," she says. Underlying information also can be used 
            to automatically generate wire lists, cable layouts, wire labels, 
            panel layouts, and even purchase orders for accounting. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic cross-referencing and error-checking, 
            whether performed continuously, upon file-saving, or as a separate 
            subroutine, also can help schematic software earn its keep. "The 
            later errors show up, the more expensive they are," says Felicia 
            Moore, Mayfield Village, Ohio-based program manager for Rockwell 
            Software's RSWires. (To date, the company's RSWires software is 
            largely based on a private-label agreement with ECT International, 
            with Rockwell Automation's extensive global distribution and support 
            network the key differentiator.) </P>
            <P><B>What to look for</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>In addition to the typical 
            laundry-list of bells and whistles that stack up slightly 
            differently from package to package, several overarching issues need 
            to be considered when selecting an electrical schematic software 
            package. Primary among these are open hooks for integration with 
            other software packages and databases, flexibility for individual 
            customization, and ease of use and implementation. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of openness, import and export compatibility 
            with accepted graphics and database formats are essential. "A 
            computer-aided engineering package should be able to draw 
            information into the design through ODBC from your parts library," 
            says EPAN's Mr. Bernier. "It should also be able to take virtually 
            any project information and export it to an ASCII file, to feed into 
            downstream systems such as PLC [programmable logic controller] 
            programming software or a manufacturing resources planning system 
            for ordering." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Links with PLC programming software are an especially 
            (ahem) logical synergy for electrical schematic software developers. 
            "There are overlaps in the information involved and sometimes it's 
            tough to make sure they match," says Rockwell Software's Ms. Moore. 
            For example, if the wire list documentation is lost, several 
            packages can recreate an I/O list from the programming logic itself. 
            Growing compatibility with PC-based logic engines as well as design 
            tools tailored to device-level networks are other trends to watch. 
            </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Schematic software should also provide sufficient 
            flexibility so that users don't have to change the way they develop 
            their documentation. "Few companies appreciate being told that they 
            must do things a certain way, and standards differ from one company 
            to another," reports VIA's Mr. Howe. "Flexibility is key," says 
            Harold Jezierski, president of Aucotec, Buffalo Grove, Ill. "for 
            example, you need to be able to generate wire lists that match the 
            user's manufacturing practices." </P>
            <P>&nbsp; "Inevitably, there are little things they want to 
            customize," adds Tom Stawicki, TCS president. "For these situations, 
            it's important to have a high-level, controls-specific language for 
            developing custom functions." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final major considerations are ease of 
            implementation and ease of use. Few new ways of doing things are 
            faster overnight: How long will it take to get back to and exceed a 
            break-even level of productivity? Drafters and designers who use the 
            tools everyday are one thing, but for the engineer or other 
            occasional user who may shift from design to implementation, then 
            back to design, intuitive use is especially important. </P>
            <P><B>AutoCAD add-on or standalone?</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>The best answer to this question may 
            well be in the eyes ofthe beholder. On one side, many users 
            currently evaluating electrical schematic software are AutoCAD 
            users. For example, ECT president Arthur Sawall estimates that 90% 
            of his company's inquiries come from the already AutoCAD-initiated. 
            "Standalone is a tough sell," he says, "I'm convinced that Autodesk 
            drives the market." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, "A big feature that people like is 
            the true Windows interface,' says EPLAN's Mr. Bernier of his 
            company's stand-alone offering. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on whether users are engineers or 
            designer and drafters," admits Rockwell Software's Ms. Moore. 
            "Designers and drafters are familiar with AutoCAD, but engineers may 
            be more familiar with Excel--they're more used to the Microsoft 
            environment," she says. As a result, AutoCAD-based developers such 
            Rockwell and ECT continue to hone the overall usability of their 
            software, attempting to balance the best of both worlds. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the not-too-distant future, however, this may 
            prove a nonissue. After a decidedly late move to Windows from DOS 
            with its AutoCAD 13 release, Autodesk and Microsoft now appear to 
            have a much closer working relationship that should be reflected in 
            AutoCAD 14, currently under development. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the electrical schematic software 
            alternatives, pricing ranges from $5,000-$10,000 for a full-featured 
            version. Limited functionality, view-only licenses also are 
            available typically starting at $500. But for most users, pricing is 
            a distantsecondary consideration to features and platform 
            familiarity.With the exception, that is, of companies that are 
            looking beyond their "core" CAD users to "adjacent" users who could 
            benefit from technical schematic technology. For those users, whomay 
            outnumber core users 10 to one, a full-blown electrical schematic 
            package (much less a $3,500 AutoCAD license) simply isn't feasible. 
            </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That's where a new breed of mass-market schematic 
            software tools such as Seattle-based Visio Corp.'s Visio Technical 
            may be suitable. Not a drawing package, but not an electrical 
            controls package either, the $399 Visio is designed for a broad 
            range of design/drafting applications that employ a high degree of 
            predefined symbol content. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wayne Bandy, an electrical and instrumentation 
            systems consultant based in Squaw Valley, Calif., has been involved 
            in an Exxon project where Visio Technical was used to bridge the gap 
            between the field technicians installing control systems and the 
            professional engineers who designed and approved them. "Full AutoCAD 
            wasn't feasible for the field, so we put Visio on industrial 
            computers; technicians could make as-built changes to the drawings 
            right there and then." The changes were then reviewed and stamped by 
            the legally responsible professional engineers. "Visio is good for 
            keeping separation between the technical and professional sides of 
            the house," Mr. Bandy says. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic technical schematic tools like Visio also 
            hold the promise of becoming a more suitable platform alternative to 
            AutoCAD for niche products such as electrical controls. "We know the 
            mass market, but because the technology is so programmable, third 
            parties have the power and flexibility to do develop their own 
            custom libraries," says Dirk Meyer, Visio Technical product 
            marketing manager. </P>
            <P><B>Objects are cost of entry</B> </P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>Essentially all of the reasons for 
            using electrical schematic software instead of a mechanical CAD 
            package derive from the concept of object orientation. Pictures must 
            retain the properties of the devices they represent, and connecting 
            lines must behave like real-world wires. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need attributes in my CAE tools," summarizes an 
            engineer working for one of the Big Three car-makers. "Instead of a 
            dumb drawing, I need objects that have attributes." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In part because it already has charted a course 
            independent of AutoCAD, EPLAN already uses an object-oriented 
            database engine. But Autodesk (following Microsoft's lead) and all 
            of the AutoCAD-based electrical controls suppliers (following 
            Autodesk's lead) will incorporate increasing amounts of object 
            technology into their next-generation packages. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Currently, users are forced into a top-down approach 
            to control system design, starting with the schematic," comments 
            TCS' Mr. Stawicki. "Users now want to be able to attack the design 
            problem from a number of different angles." For example, to start 
            with a function chart or parts list and work toward a schematic. 
            "Object-oriented databases make this possible." </P>

            options that can be used to connect remote parts of the process to 
            the rest of the plant. They're used in those cases where it's 
            impractical or impossible to connect nodes using wire, cables, or 
            fiber optics. Radio frequency data links, infrared data links, and 
            powerline communications techniques are already in use daily in many 
            industrial applications. </P>

            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>There are several types of radio 
            frequency (RF) data transmission systems on the market. Some use the

            modulation techniques. However, new families of digital techniques 
            have entered the market. These are commonly grouped under the 
            heading "spread spectrum." </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread spectrum (SS) RF networks are playing a 
            growing role in the connection of today's sensors, actuators, and 
            control systems. Essentially, SS is a technique in which a 
            transmitted signal is spread over a frequency range that is greater 
            than the minimum bandwidth normally required for information 
            transmis-sion. The purpose is to improve the bit error rate in the 
            presence of noise or interference. Other advantages of the SS 
            approach include reduced interference with other signals, resistance 
            to jamming, improved privacy, and the ability for multiple users to 
            share the same channel. </P>

            transmission. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicable to both stationary and semimobile uses, 
            infrared data transmission converts electrical data pulses into 
            light signals, and back into electrical pulses on the receiving end. 
            Such a network is contactless since the transmission is optical

            expanded, taking space in the same building where this magazine is

            laser-driven, high-speed, infrared data link that spans a distance 
            close to that of a football field. This saves the on-going expense 
            of using a dedicated phone line to interconnect the two sites while 
            enhancing the security of the data transmission. The only

            <P><FONT color=#ffffff>..</FONT>Many industrial applications already 
            are supplied with electrical power. The idea of powerline 
            communications is to use this wire to send data, too. "Reliable data 
            communications with rates to 100 kbps over existing power lines is 
            possible using a patented spread-spectrum technique," says Eric 
            Hughes, marketing manager for Adaptive Networks, Inc. (Brighton, 
            Mass.) "The signals can be transmitted over ac or dc power lines 
            from 110 to 480 V, 50/60 Hz and can be carried by multiphase lines 
            as well. Distances up to four miles are practical and up to 65,000 
            nodes can be connected to the same network." </P>
