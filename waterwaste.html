DST Controls understands the regulatory scrutiny and cost pressures that municipalities and their contractors face everyday. Hence our detailed pre-bid specification reviews, rigorous procurement processes, efficient project management, in-depth understanding of water and waste treatment processes, and our distaste for change orders all make DST an ideal sub-contractor in municipal automation projects!
