<P><font face="Arial">The secret is out: engineers like to shop. At
      least, when it comes to components. And, while the retail industry may
      still overlook engineers, control manufacturers are listening and
      responding to their urge to scour catalogs, talk to sales people, and
      contemplate multiple purchasing decisions. The result -- which permits
      engineers to buy devices from any vendor's line and create a control
      system -- is called open architecture, and it has changed the way we
      design and engineer.</font> </P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Opening more than windows</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Because the concept of open architecture has
      evolved over two decades, manufacturers and engineers have varying
      definitions of &quot;open.&quot; In the 1980s, an open system involved
      practical network connectivity issues. Designers selected components from
      within proprietary product lines and searched for an open answer to
      communication at the host-computer level. The connotation of open
      eventually expanded to include operating systems. Unix was considered open
      because essential elements were in the public domain. Additionally,
      platform vendors -- such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard -- supported the
      environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Today, most people have an even broader
      definition of open architecture. This definition was steered by the
      automotive industry and reflects the mid-1990s white paper,
      &quot;Requirements of Open, Modular Architecture Controllers for
      Applications in the Automotive Industry.&quot; An open system now means
      that an engineer can select components from multiple vendors and construct
      a seamless system. This definition encompasses every level of control
      components. Theoretically, a system could include an open PLC from one
      manufacturer, stepper modules from another, HMI from a third source, and
      so on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Multiple-vendor component integration gives
      engineers the flexibility and buying power that they lacked when locked
      into proprietary product lines. Because devices integrate, designs should
      include only the best-in-class products that the market has to offer for
      particular applications. Additionally, engineers can choose one
      comfortable control philosophy and integrate components that work best
      with their scheme.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For example, Alvey Systems, Inc., a Pinnacle
      Automation company, wanted a smart distributed system as the basis for
      conveyor and palletizing applications. All other components are designed
      around the intelligent I/O concept. Alvey integrated GE Fanuc <a href="http://www.gefanuc.com/plc/9030.html" target="_blank">Series
      90<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>-30 PLCs</a> into the design because these open devices provide
      enhanced features that support the selected I/O, the Honeywell Smart
      Distributed System (SDS). The PLCs fully integrate with the SDS, despite
      the difference in manufacturers. This combination of GE Fanuc's SDS
      interface and Honeywell's I/O offers the solution of choice for Alvey.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In addition to acquiring the best technology
      at the beginning of a design, engineers can substitute new components from
      any vendor into existing machines. In the past, these upgrades had to wait
      for developments within proprietary product lines. With open architecture,
      control systems can grow with industry technology -- rather than growing
      with an individual vendor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">And, buying power doesn't just buy
      components. It also helps engineers acquire the best technical assistance
      and training. Because one manufacturer's products can substitute for
      another, competition within the control industry remains fierce.
      Value-added services in the form of systems support can make all the
      difference in final selection. Engineers can avoid companies that resort
      to problem finger-pointing and search for those that offer real
      assistance. Thus, manufacturers are not only trying to design the best
      open systems but also improving training, service -- and sometimes -- even
      prices.</font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Can we talk?</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The heart of open architecture is
      communication -- whether between devices or as a connectivity issue. On
      the connectivity side, open systems have facilitated communication within
      control processes. More types of devices can be added to a network and
      controlled seamlessly as one system. The technology also supports remote
      monitoring and control. Engineers can access systems through a modem or
      over the Internet from any location. In many applications, Ethernet is
      emerging as the network of choice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Open architecture is particularly important
      when connectivity requirements vary from one machine to the next. <b>DST
      Controls</b> recently designed a system for Air Liquide -- whose customers
      want connectivity ranging from Ethernet to a simple serial port. To meet
      their requirements, DST developed the controls for a hazardous gas
      distribution system that includes <a href="http://www.gefanuc.com/plc/9030.html">Series
      90-30 PLCs</a>. These PLCs offer expanded communication protocol
      capabilities that allow Air Liquide's customers to achieve their
      individual level of connectivity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Open architecture also facilitates
      communication between process and business management. Analysts can review
      production processes online and manipulate data in spreadsheets and
      reports. With this more accurate and timely information, business
      management has the ability to refine strategies and logistics -- as well
      as speed response to crisis situations.</font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Keeping options open</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There's no doubt that open systems offer
      benefits and that motion control -- driven by the automotive industry --
      is moving in this direction. While manufacturers have responded to this
      trend, some would say the response has been too quick. Just about every
      manufacturer now claims to have some open products. With the varying
      definitions of openness, it's difficult for engineers to assess whether
      these claims are valid, which can lead to major integration problems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The validity of these claims recently added
      three frustrating weeks to a DST Controls design. The system involved
      compliance with MMS. DST selected devices from GE Fanuc and another
      manufacturer, which both claimed full compliance. However, only GE Fanuc
      had implemented the full version while the other company had implemented
      the draft. DST could not integrate the devices until first identifying the
      problem and then correcting to accommodate the draft-version protocol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In addition to invalid claims, the many
      levels of component openness complicate control engineering and design.
      Table 1 shows just some of the standards and protocols that dictate
      openness. Individual components vary with type of device as well as
      manufacturer. In the case of field buses, there is no recognized industry
      standard, and engineers must wade through a conflicting and competitive
      jungle. Plus, the protocols change frequently as new trends enter the
      motion control industry, which increases the complexity of system design
      and upgrade.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">To reduce this complexity, engineers need to
      assess the openness of products. The only way to do this -- after reading
      product literature and manuals -- is through testing under application
      specifications. Tests allow control engineers to evaluate products,
      attempt full integration, and monitor prototype performance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For the Air Liquide control system, DST
      tested all components within the lab before finalizing design. Preliminary
      criteria identified by Air Liquide's wafer fabrication customers guided
      the tests. At the top of this list was flexibility, which lends itself to
      open architecture. The controller had to be easily configurable to
      accommodate a wide range of international end-users' needs.
      Customer-specific &quot;moving targets&quot; included unique
      computer/software systems and local area networks, requiring bidirectional,
      plug-and-play communication. System security requirements varied from
      complex multi-level password access, to key switches, to no restrictions
      at all. Testing helped DST select a variety of devices and attempt
      integration across manufacturing lines. Full product compliance with
      standards -- as implemented by GE Fanuc -- facilitated testing and
      verification. The resulting system permits customers to choose specific
      devices, including even the PLCs, as options to meet their individual
      needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Alvey also recommends testing to assess
      product openness. For a conveyor application, the company is evaluating
      PC-control software from four different vendors, including GE Fanuc's
      CIMPLICITY<sup>&reg;</sup> PC Control. The tests allow the company to work
      with the packages away from customer sites. Alvey engineers first
      developed selection criteria, including speed, HMI interfaces, programming
      options, and IEC-1113 compliance. They identified and acquired other
      devices that would need to work with the software. So far, the tests have
      revealed that none of the packages meet all of their requirements.
      Additionally, some packages limit the choices of I/O systems and HMI. The
      Alvey team is currently evaluating third-party agreements that expand
      design options with fully integrated wrap-around products.</font></p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Open for business</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Third-party partnerships, another trend in
      the control industry, involve vendors working with one another to develop
      products that expand on each others' features and integrate seamlessly.
      Qualified manufacturers create modules that help customers with a wide
      variety of needs take advantage of specific devices.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For example, GE Fanuc opened up its PLC
      backplane to accommodate Horner Electric modules as part of its Accompany
      Program. These devices plug directly into the Series 90-70 VME backplane
      and the Series 90-30 backplane. Now, customers can purchase a GE Fanuc PLC
      and acquire seamless integration with a Horner Electric module.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Essentially, these partnerships help
      engineers identify which control components integrate easily with another
      manufacturers' products. The components -- and their communication with
      one another -- are validated by the manufacturer to save end-users the
      time and expense involved with testing. This process consumes about 40
      percent of vendor costs to develop new products.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">However, even with validation, engineers face
      integration challenges. The move toward open architecture is still new
      enough that most devices are not validated for communication across
      manufacturer lines. Integration may require extensive troubleshooting,
      custom cables or boards, or complete redesign. Fortunately, engineers can
      ease the process by asking manufacturers for technical assistance -- which
      is all part of buying power opening new opportunities.</font></p>
