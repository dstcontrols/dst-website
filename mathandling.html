Several of DST's "Factory Authorized Integrator" certifications from control equipment manufacturers have been in "Material Handling Automation." This, because of the variety and depth of DST experience with numerous conveyor types, carousels, and palletizers etc.
<br><br>
From Bulk and Sack Mail conveying systems in Chicago, to plastic pellet screw conveyors in New Jersey, DST knows how to engineer control systems that will get materials of any shape, size, or weight from point A to point B.  
<br><br>
Reliable product detection is critical to any material handling system, and DST remains an industry leader in integrating state-of-the-art sensor technologies into custom material handling systems of all kinds.</td>
