DST's 14,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility makes two distinct offers to its customers:
<ul>
	<li><i>Custom Control Panels</i>
	<li><i>Outsourced Subsystem Manufacturing (OSM)</i>
</ul>
<br>
        <b><i>Custom Control Panels:</i></b> Our in-house Panel Shop is UL 508A 
        registered and ISO 9001:2000 certified. It has been providing high-quality/low-cost 
        control and electrical panels to end-users, OEMS, and contractors around 
        the world for more than 30 years. This includes enclosures containing 
        computer, PLC, relay & pneumatic control, variable speed drive, servo 
        & stepper control, custom MCC, and power distribution equipment. <br>
        <br>
Intrinsically-safe requirements are a DST specialty; as are UL, CSA, and EU compliance. 
<br><br>
DST's wiring and assembly group can build to our customers' specifications, or they can&mdash;with DST's engineering and field staff&mdash;turn-key a project from conceptualization through installation.
<br><br>
<b><i>Outsourced Subsystem Manufacturing</i> or OSM (pronounced "<i>Awesome</i>"):</b>
DST's OSM group specializes in higher-volume production of electrical or electronic based subsystems. This can be as simple as assembling a few wiring harnesses for a microscopic x-ray system or as complicated as designing, building, programming, and servicing over one thousand PLC & HMI based controllers that regulate the delivery of arsine gas, one of the most toxic substances on the planet.
<br><br>
OSM's offer to DST's customers is <i>lower cost, higher quality,</i> and <i>faster delivery</i> than they can accomplish themselves.
<br><br>
Serving both DST's custom panel shop and OSM group, our Procurement Department actually operates as a profit-center for our customers. Cost-cutting tactics used by our experienced and tough-minded purchasing people include supplier pricing alliances, volume purchasing leverage, and web-based RFQ & order entry. Coupled with a contemporary globalized procurement philosophy that makes lowering costs their "Prime Directive," DST-Procurement uses the aforementioned tools to insure the highest quality components, at the lowest possible cost, delivered in the shortest time possible.
