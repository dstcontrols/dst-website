      do this cow and these lips have in common? Hint: It improves the lips’
      appearance but does little for the cow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Televised events,
      such as the Grammys or Academy Awards, show the public more than a few
      &quot;baby boom&quot; entertainers still sporting Generation-X faces. If
      we asked how they do it, they might tell us it’s their relationship with
      their personal trainer, a vegetarian diet, or yoga. But their real ally
      against time, gravity, or &quot;bad-face&quot; genes is often
      super-purified bovine collagen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collagen is an
      animal protein found in the subcutaneous (just beneath the skin) tissues
      of all mammals—though it is particularly abundant in cows. Collagen is a
      safe and easily injected tissue thickener used in cosmetic and remedial
      medicine. Its most common cosmetic uses are to enhance lip borders and
      fill in wrinkles due to aging or injury. It is also used in sphincter
      resizing as a treatment for stress-induced incontinence. Because it has
      few side effects, is of &quot;natural’’ origin, and relatively
      inexpensive, collagen competes favorably with more invasive alternatives
      such as surgery.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the surface—no
      pun intended—producing collagen is simple. Medical products company,
      McGhan Medical (Fremont, Calif.), gets some cowhides, removes the hair;
      chops the hide into fine pieces, soaks them in a series of emulsifiers at
      the right temperatures for the right amount of time. This mixture is then
      centrifuged to separate the collagen from the soup, which is then purified
      to specification, packaged in disposable syringes, and shipped to
      physician customers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once a batch is
      complete, the process equipment must be thoroughly cleaned before a new
      batch can be started. Interestingly, the Clean-In-Place (CIP) procedure
      gets the same amount of attention as the rest of the process by the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Taking the high
      road</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      Because McGhan Medical needed to meet FDA product safety requirements
      consistently, it decided against a minimally functioned CIP control system
      for its collagen manufacturing line. McGhan opted for as much control and
      data acquisition capability as possible that could be easily supported by
      its in-house staff and third-party suppliers. The new CIP monitoring and
      control system was expected to meet the following criteria.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ensure that the
          CIP system works reliably, rendering the process vessels and piping
          molecularly spotless after every product run—or alarm loudly if it
          isn’t second.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Verify CIP
          reliability by documenting the system’s operational and production
          history, and archive this information in FDA-acceptable formats for
          periodic comparisons with original IQ/OQ benchmark documentation. (See
          accompanying sidebar.)</font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allow for process
          expansion to include new products or increased product outputs.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Multiple (as many as
      10) wash and rinse cycles are required to thoroughly remove leftover
      material from 36 locations in the process piping and vessels. Each
      location, which can range from a 2-ft pipe section with a 2-in. diameter
      to a 1,000 gal tank, requires its own set of cleaning recipes. The key
      component in the rinse cycles is water pure enough for human injection or
      Water For Injection (WFI).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critical CIP
      parameters controlled include pressure, temperature, flow, and solution
      conductivity (mS or µS). Conductivity values determine cycle times and
      indicate presence of either cleaning solution or process material in
      &quot;neutral&quot; WFI.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">CIP
      process</font></b><br>
      This Clean-In-Place process has four parts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Step one</i>—the
      CIP system performs a test WFI rinse cycle to ensure safe piping
      installation and proper valve orientation. The control system monitors
      required parameters, alarms any nonconformance, validates the
      configuration, and triggers the next step.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Step two</i>—piping
      and tanks are washed with a low-concentrate acid solution. During this
      cycle, the system precisely measures the amount of solution used and its
      electrical conductivity. If the conductivity threshold is met, the control
      system advances the CIP to the next step. If not, this step is repeated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Step three</i>—piping
      and vessels are neutralized and cleaned with steam-heated caustic
      solution. The control system now monitors this solution’s temperature,
      conductivity, and flow rate. When all parameters are satisfied, the system
      moves to the next step in the cycle.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Step four</i>—this
      last step is a series of WFI rinses, monitored for time and conductivity.
      Steps one through four are repeated as long as conductivity values
      indicate process residue or nonconforming pH levels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Flexibility
      in an inflexible world</font></b><br>
      System security is vital in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Maintaining
      security while increasing flexibility may seem oxymoronic, but flexible
      security is just what McGhan wanted. Hence the project’s system
      integrator, <a href="http://www.dstcontrols.com" target="_parent">DST
      Controls</a> (Benicia, Calif.), designed into the system three levels of
      critical access security. Each security level (administration,
      engineering, or operation) allows only personnel logged-in and cleared for
      that level to perform associated actions. All critical operational changes
      require someone from each security level to be on hand. Additionally, a
      database stores every authorized and unauthorized system login or logout.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For additional
      safety, alarms report system failures, hardware failures, process warnings
      and failures, and system-resource (CPU load, archive space, etc.)
      warnings. On one screen, alarms display chronologically by importance and
      system-impact. Alarm acknowledgements, and when-cleared, are also logged
      into the alarm database. Report capability includes daily summary, user
      logins, alarms, messaging, process and batch data, and user activities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In case of system
      malfunction, unsafe conditions and unknown states are prevented by the
      system’s ability to trigger specific behavior for each control system
      level. These levels include the I/O modules, PLC, operator stations,
      including the computer system, its power source, data storage, and
      printer. Additionally, the system is designed to execute a series of
      actions (status check of sensors, valves, and pumps) that prepare the
      process for a safe and efficient restart in case of an in-process
      shutdown.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The system’s PLC
      continually monitors the PC’s &quot;heart beat.&quot; If, for any
      reason, the PLC doesn’t sense the PC’s presence, ordered shutdown is
      commenced so that the process won’t continue without FDA-required data
      acquisition. In case of power failure, an uninterruptible power supply
      provides a minimum of five minutes of continued system power. This allows
      a safe shutdown, prevents data loss, enables storage of current
      configuration data, and properly auto-configures various I/O devices for
      the eventual re-start.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Help
      and communication</font></b><br>
      The CIP system is equipped with messaging, on-line help, user prompts, and
      &quot;entry validity checks.&quot; This support structure leads users
      through correct operation, assists in training new staff, and minimizes
      &quot;pilot error&quot; and consequent shutdowns. As messages prompt users
      through necessary process steps and advise them on current system
      conditions, the HMI system’s embedded safety interlocks prevent users
      from overlapping (covering) a more critical screen with a less critical
      one. This is especially helpful on those rare occasions when &quot;stuff <i>really</i>
      happens.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The control system
      also performs validity checks of process values and user-entered set
      points. For example, if a set point entered by a user is out of range, the
      system rejects the entry and restores the default value. The user is then
      notified on-screen with an explanation of the rejection. All attempted
      invalid entries and process values are logged and reported.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, DST
      Controls provided complete FDA-ready validation packages for the IQ and OQ.
      These packages included test protocols, formal change control procedures,
      and factory and site-acceptance tests for installation and operation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">System
      specifics</font><br>
      </b>An Intellution (Norwood, Mass.) Fix Dynamics package tracks 300 tags
      via 20 process screens, including alarm, login, tending, and recipe
      selection screens. A Microsoft Visual Basic application interface sends
      data to and from a Microsoft Access database, serves as data acquisition
      software, and provides an operator interface for the recipe engine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://www.rockwellautomation.com" target="_parent">Rockwell
      Automation/Allen-Bradley</a> (Mayfield Heights, O.) SLC 505-based control
      system, for CIP functions, consists of 350 analog and digital I/O points.
      PLC communications with the I/O screens, remote I/O modules, and the
      manufacturing process are through Data Highway 485 and Ethernet
      communications. The PLC executes variable recipes, monitors alarm
      conditions, and controls output devices.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Microsoft
      Windows NT- based system maintains data generated by the process and runs
      on an Intel Pentium 300 industrial computer with 256 Mb RAM and two
      redundant 800 Mb (RAID-1) hard drives. The visual interface is handled by
      two color touchscreens mounted in custom NEMA-4X stainless steel panels. A
      redundant second screen allows remote CIP start/run/stop and monitoring
      from the manufacturing process’ clean room.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, what do this cow
      and these lips have in common? For patients in need, or those just
      aesthetically so inclined, collagen products manufactured using this
      system offer a less invasive alternative to the surgeon’s scalpel or
      laser knife. In either case, this control solution ensures that
      alternative is safe—and provides the data to prove it.</font></p>

              regulatory mechanisms the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
              uses to ensure pharmaceutical product quality and safety are the
              Installation Qualification (IQ) and the Operations Qualification (OQ).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IQ requires
              complete documentation of all system components immediately upon
              installation. This &quot;photograph&quot; of the physical system
              becomes the process benchmark to which the FDA holds the user
              responsible. Once the IQ documentation or &quot;validation&quot;
              has been submitted to the FDA, any component change requires all
              parts of the affected system to be revalidated.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OQ dictates
              that all software functions and instructions are also reduced to a
              defining documentation package to be approved and archived by the
              FDA. As with the IQ, no functional OQ changes can be made without
              voiding FDA approval and triggering a new validation process
              before sellable product can be run. This micro-scrutiny ensures
              that once a pharmaceutical process is proven to consistently
              produce acceptable (i.e., safe) product, it is not allowed to
              drift out of its FDA-approved configuration, which could call
              output quality into question.</font></p>
