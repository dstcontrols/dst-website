        in a fiber-optic network is not the same as on a conventional one.
        Because information is so compressed in a fiber-optic system, a single
        fiber break can do much more damage to the flow of data. Turan Erdogan,
        director at the University of Rochester’s Institute of Optics
        (Rochester, N.Y.), says an &quot;inchworm-sized&quot; device situated

        efficiently it’s performing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previous devices that performed this
        function were complicated and quite large, hampering adaptability within
        the system. The new device has no moving parts and will fit anywhere a
        fiber can go. This line-tester for the fiber-optic era self-monitors
        each strand and indicates when there is trouble. The detector works by
        comparing component wavelengths up- and downstream, using a tiny
        photodetector on a chip. It can accurately report what wavelengths are
        moving through the monitored fiber.</font></p>

 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fiber optics has been adapted to industrial use
 for a number of reasons. In communications, whether in plant networks or
 process instruments, fiber-optics technology offers advantages over traditional
 copper wiring or cable. Data can be transmitted digitally and at greatly
 increased speed. Fiber cable is superior to copper wires because it is immune
 to corrosion, vibration, and electromagnetic (EMI) and radio frequency
 interference (RFI). In network applications, it has superior transmission
 quality and is generally easier to install and maintain.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Mike Shulim, director of engineering for DST
 Controls, a system integrator located in Benicia, Calif.</b>, placed noise
 immunity at the top of his list of reasons to consider fiber optics in a
 control network situation. &quot;Additionally, fiber-optic networks have
 ‘no’ life,&quot; Mr. Shulim commented. &quot;Copper-based systems degrade
 with age. After 10 to 15 years speed of transmission drops and internally
 generated noise increases. Fiber-optic systems have an effective life three
 times that of copper. Definitely a long-term solution.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, fiber-optic conductors are much
 smaller, lighter, and more flexible than copper wire. Development of low-cost
 optical transducers and advancements in optical-fiber manufacturing now makes
 it cost competitive with conventional wiring. Bandwidth is very high compared
 to conventional wire cable (two hair-thin strands of optical fiber can transmit
 the equivalent of 24,000 telephone calls at the same time. It takes two copper
 wires contained in a much thicker cable to carry just one call. Termination and
 spicing of fiber-optic cable (especially in the field), once its Achilles’
 heel, has improved greatly since its appearances in the 1970s, ushering it into
 prominence in modern digital communication.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr. Shulim points out that use of optical fibers
 in control installations, especially retrofits and system expansions, is cost
 comparable to running copper conductors. &quot;Users can run fiber-optic cables
 in the same conduit and trays as existing power cables with no ‘noise’
 concerns and save on installation time and cost.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Mr. Shulim, the smaller, flexible
 cable is generally easier to install, however, technicians must pay closer
 attention to detail. Overstretching of cable and poor termination can prove
 disastrous. Quality variations in poorly specified cable can also be a problem.
 Says Mr. Shulim, &quot;As little as two inches of bad cable can disable a
 system. In general, fiber optics is less forgiving of installation
 errors.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Change of scale<br>
 </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Fiber-optic technology has been adapted
 to control instrumentation applications often for the same reasons that make it
 a good choice for networking. FiberFlex, a nuclear continuous level detector
 developed by Ohmart/Vega
 Corp. (Cincinnati, O.), incorporates a fiber-optic bundle for the
 device’s scintillator.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuclear continuous level measurement works by
 directing a narrow fan of radiation through a vessel to a detector or
 scintillator. Within a fiber-optic scintillator, radiation creates photons,
 then measured with electronics and correlated with liquid level. As the process
 level rises, it shields the detector from the radiation. The more radiation the
 detector &quot;sees,&quot; the lower the process level (discernable to 1% of
 span); less radiation detected means a higher level.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To avoid &quot;blind spots&quot; and ensure
 accurate readings, scintillators must conform to the vessel wall opposite the
 gamma ray source. As the name implies, flexible, lightweight fiber optics
 allows FiberFlex to be easily installed to measurement lengths of 23 ft.</font></p>

        India’s West Coast.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It includes the world’s largest &quot;greenfield&quot;
        refinery, the world’s largest paraxylene plant, Asia’s largest
        polypropylene plant, a 360 MW (India’s largest) captive power plant, a
        marine tank farm, a complete distribution terminal, plus India’s
        largest private sector port. The complex uses the latest and most
        advanced processes, automation, information technology, and networking
        available. RIL joined with main engineering contractor, Bechtel (San
        Francisco, Calif.) to perform all design work. It was constructed at an
        investment of $6 billion US. The complex uses Foxboro
        (Foxboro, Mass.) I/A Series control systems, Triconex ESD (Irvine,
        Calif.) process protective systems, and a SAP (Norwood, Mass.) R/3 ERP
        system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A total of 310 miles of fiber-optic cable
        was installed to connect the various automation systems within this
        massive complex. Systems and associated networking for each were
        supplied by Foxboro India (I/A Series DCS and terminal automation
        systems, plus Triconex ESD systems), Wormald U.K. (fire and gas control
        system), Bently Nevada U.K. (machine condition monitoring system), and
        Rockwell Automation U.K. (PLC systems).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Approximately 155 miles of fiber-optic
        control network links the five major I/A Series systems within the
        complex. Systems controlled include the refinery and marine terminal
        (the largest I/A Series system installed anywhere), the aromatics plant,
        the polypropylene plant, the complex’s captive power plant, and port
        operations</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fiber-optic &quot;Nodebus Extenders&quot;
        connect physically distributed control node segments within common I/A
        Series systems. This includes the one that controls the refinery and
        marine terminal, which are located at total local area network (LAN)
        length of more than 12 miles apart within the complex. However, RIL
        placed them on a common control system to ease data transfer between the
        Foxboro-provided advanced offsite applications (tank information, oil
        movements, and blend optimization/supervision) and the refinery unit
        controls.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A fiber-optic carrierband LAN also
        connects all five control systems, plus other plant systems, onto a
        common Plant Information Network (PIN). The PIN provides authorized
        users throughout the complex with access to any real-time process
        display or historical information across the five control systems. This
        network is almost 13 miles in length and is composed almost entirely of
        commercial off-the-shelf fiber-optic components.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to providing the most
        cost-effective solution for accommodating the very large distances
        involved, fiber optics provide other benefits over conventional copper
        media. These include superior electrical isolation to protect equipment
        from ground loops as well as electrical discharges from severe
        thunderstorms common at the site, and freedom from RMI and EMI
        interference. Additionally, the fiber-optic system’s high bandwidth
        handles the large amount of communications traffic—data, voice, and
        video—that flows over the Reliance Jamnagar PIN today, as well as the
        even higher communications rates for future expansions.</font></p>

 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Kevin Carmichael, chief engineer at
 Ohmart/Vega, &quot;nuclear devices are often the technology of last
 resort&quot; when it comes to measuring continuous level. Nuclear measurement
 is used for level values in processes where materials are extremely hot,
 corrosive, hazardous, or viscous. In short, because of high cost and
 complexity, it is used when no other technology will work.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Clear vision<br>
 </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all fiber-optic materials are
 created equal. In fact, communications with its &quot;on and off &quot; digital
 mode can use a different grade of fiber optics than do instruments that must
 convey a clear image of what the sensor &quot;sees.&quot; Used in medical
 examination equipment such as endoscopes, these materials have been adapted to
 industrial temperature sensors. In the case of infrared sensors, fiber-optic
 cable can be used to connect a sensing head that must be mounted separate from
 the processing electronics. Fiber optics’ intrinsic immunity to temperature
 and electromagnetic interference enhances this type of application.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Marathon FR1 noncontact ratio thermometer
 developed by Raytek
 Corp. (Santa Cruz, Calif.) is among practical examples of this technology.
 The sensor is said provide the accuracy and stability of a two-color
 ratio-thermometer even in high temperature (in this case, 200 °C) and
 electrically &quot;noisy&quot; environments. The fiber-optic cable is available
 in lengths up to 33 ft and can be replaced in the field without need for
 recalibration. The FR1 is currently available in three models, covering a range
 of 500 to 2,500 °C. It is intended for harsh operating environments, including
 metals and glass production.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A common use for this type of fiber-optic
 instrument is in carbon anode &quot;baking.&quot; In the reduction of aluminum,
 carbon anodes are consumed during the electrolysis process. Efficient
 manufacture of these anodes, which are often larger than a cubic meter and
 consumed by the hundreds, is key to aluminum production. Anodes are molded from
 a slurry of calcified green coke and distilled coal tar. They are then baked in
 gas/oil-fired pits at temperatures greater than 1,000 °C for several days to
 develop the best physical and electrical properties. Controlling the baking
 process requires accurate monitoring of temperature at the top of the baking
 pit.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Originally handled by Type S
 thermocouples/protection tubes, pit air temperatures can now be measured more
 accurately using fiber-optic sensors. Leveraging fiber-optic sensor accuracy,
 immunity to noise, and ability to mount electronics remotely, many aluminum
 smelters have embraced fiber-optic sensor technology for this demanding
 application.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fiber-optic cable can also be used for level
 sensing and provide both intrinsic safety and eliminate RFI/EMI concerns. Kinematics
 &amp; Controls Corp. (Brooksville, Fla.) uses a plastic fiber to send red
 visible light to a prismatic tip located in the sensor head of a level switch.
 If the switch is dry, light reflects back to the remotely mounted controller.
 However when the liquid level reaches and submerges the sensor, light refracts
 into the media and none is returned. The controller then produces the
 appropriate output for signaling PLCs or driving relay coils.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Commonly used to monitor levels of flammable
 liquids, the sensor cables are available in 20-ft lengths for applications up
 to 100 ft away. Tiny fiber-optic heads, as small as 0.25-in. dia., can fit in
 tight locations. Use of fiber optics eliminates heat sensitive components at
 the sensor, allowing the device to sense liquids at temperatures above 300 °F,
 if required.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Splitting things up<br>
 </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Separating electronics from a sensor
 head via a fiber-optic cable has also been adapted to photoelectric sensor
 design. Without ability to transmit light to its electronics, photocells would
 have to integrate sensor and electronics in the package. Size of such packages
 (even with the degree of electronics’ miniaturization now available) can
 inhibit mounting flexibility and convenience.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Charley Strobel, senior tech
 support engineer, for Keyence
 Corp. of America (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.), separating the two components
 offers real advantages. In the case of its FS-V10 Series photoelectric sensors,
 Keyence provided a small sensor head that could be used in &quot;tight&quot;
 mechanical locations and allow users to mount electronics in any convenient
 remote location up to 33 ft away.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because remote electronics are not &quot;in the
 way&quot; of the sensor and can be packaged as desired, both electronic and
 mechanical features can be optimized. &quot;Bigger&quot; electronics can lower
 response times, provide space for convenient readouts and manual controls, and
 allow features such as automatic and/or manual calibration. These types of
 sensors often detect small targets, such as registration and guide marks in
 web-processes that produce rubber and construction materials (foam insulation,
 wallboard, etc.).</font></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Bad environments<br>
 </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Damp and corrosive atmospheres can
 effect traditional copper wiring. Even in standard conduit installations,
 connections in unsealed or poorly assembled electrical boxes can corrode
 severely. Additionally, poorly shielded wiring is at the mercy of EFI and RFI.
 Control engineers faced with altering, expanding, or retrofitting a control
 system often need to use existing cable trays or pull extra wiring through
 existing conduit. Addition of new sources of electrical interference, such as
 motors, generators, standby-power equipment, or factory lighting and their
 cumulative effect on the control system can be overlooked.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To circumvent these types of problems, Poultry
 Management Systems Inc. (PMSI, Saranec, Mich.) is using Lucent
 Technologies’ (Avon, Conn.) FiberWire fiber-optic industrial
 communications system as the backbone of its &quot;chicken house&quot; control
 package. These control systems are designed to control every aspect of the
 chicken house environment, including controlling feed, water, light, air
 circulation, and egg production. The specialized egg production control package
 has been built to control the flow of eggs coming out of the houses by
 interconnecting with the environmental control system.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">FiberWire links each house’s computer to a
 central computer system that calculates which chicken house is
 &quot;laying&quot; best on a daily, weekly, or up-to-the-minute basis. This
 information then helps determine the proper environmental control needed for
 each house to produce the optimal quantity of eggs. According to Bill Kaufman,
 PMSI fiber specialist, &quot;FiberWire’s construction and resistance to
 damage, corrosion, and EMI/RFI immunity make it a perfect choice for the
 system.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Chicken house environment is dark, damp,
 and filled with ammonia and methane. Many of these complexes run on 230/460
 Volt, three-phase power extending all over the facility creating noise even
 with shielded communication cables. We had recently retrofitted an older site
 in Michigan where over $20,000 was spent trying to chase down the noise before
 turning to a fiber solution,&quot; Mr. Kaufman says.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Electrical isolation of fiber-optic cable
 offered another advantage in this application. PMSI’s farms may contain
 anywhere from 12 to 32 chicken houses, 500 ft long and 60 ft wide. Each house
 is made of steel and full of wire, a perfect attraction for lightning!
 &quot;You can imagine what would happen if we would have used copper
 wiring,&quot; says Mr. Kaufman. &quot;Lightning would be conducted all the way
 through the system taking out everything in its path.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Making inroads<br>
 </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Fiber-optic technology has illuminated
 many applications since its humble &quot;curiosity&quot; status. <b>According to
 Mike Shulim of DST Controls</b>, &quot;We have seen its use jump 200% per year for
 a while now in the controls projects we are doing.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FutureFlex Air-Blown Fiber-Optic (ABF)
        cabling system is an infrastructure of compact tube cable used in place
        of traditional inner duct to form the LAN topology. The tube cables hold
        up to 19 smaller individual tubes within the outer jacket. Once the tube
        bundle is in place, installation of the individual fiber bundles can
        begin. Essentially, the required cable bundles are blown through the
        cable tube on a stream of air or nitrogen gas at speeds up to 150 fpm
        using a proprietary cable-blowing head. Two technicians are required for
        the operation, one at each end of the intended run. If configurations
        change, cables can also be blown out of a tube (and reused) and new ones
        blown in.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to Jimi Hendrix, application
        engineer for the system, Sumitomo manufactures the blowable fiber
        bundles with 2, 6, 12, or 18 fibers in the bundle. The fibers are
        covered with a special polyethylene foam outer jacket that is dimpled
        like a golf ball, allowing the fiber to float on the air or nitrogen
        stream. A typical installation goes 3,500 ft at 100-150 ft/min,
        depending on run geometry.</font></p>
