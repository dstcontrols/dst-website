      <IMG src="../images/title.jpg" align=left width="300" height="216"><B>W</B>hat do the gases silane and arsine look like and smell like? In
      either case, you don't want to know.
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Silane is pyrophoric, so the instant this ex-NASA
      rocket-fuel accelerant gets out of the bottle and contacts air or any
      other oxygenated compound, it spontaneously ignites or explodes. As for
      arsine, OSHA has assigned it a PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) of 0.05
      ppm, which means that more than one part in 20 million can be toxic to
      humans. Anyone catching a whiff of arsine, sufficient to detect its odor,
      had better blurt out their findings fast because that person will shortly
      be dead. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Silane and arsine, and their often equally nasty siblings,
      comprise a family of specialty gases used extensively in the treatment of
      semiconductor media during the integrated-circuit fabrication process.
      Silicon wafer fabrication facilities, known as &quot;fabs,&quot; apply these gases
      to silicon wafers in arcane processes such as "etching," "doping," and
      "deposition." </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of process gases during wafer fabrication is
      hypercritical for three reasons: 1) life safety; 2)material cost (the
      hazardous nature and high purity requirements of these gases make them
      expensive to produce); and 3) quality of the final semiconductor product
      (contamination by only one errant molecule in a critical process gas can
      defect a single chip; a batch-wide, gas-purity mishap can ruin a million
      dollars worth of chips). </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Liquide Electronics (ALE, Fremont, Calif.), supplies
      specialty gas and gas distribution hardware to the electronics industry.
      "Distribution hardware" refers to manifolding, valving, tubing, and
      related controls that actually convey the gas to the fab processes. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution system's primary purpose is
      process-related because it supplies a continuous flow of expensive and
      dangerous gas to process tools. Its secondary and substantially more
      complicated task is batch related, and begins when gas flow is stopped for
      empty cylinder replacement, system maintenance, or emergency shutdown.
</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is then that safety and process-purity--less than one
      ppb of contamination--issues require that molecular residue from the gases
      be removed from the system. This clean-in-place (CIP) or "purging," is
      done via precisely executed inertgas (usually nitrogen) pressurizations
      and evacuations. </P>
      <P><B>Mechanical overview</B> </P>
      <P><IMG
            src="../images/gas%20cabinet.jpg" align=left width="300" height="415">The standard mechanical system within a fab's process area consists of
      a gas distribution module, which includes the &quot;tool(s),&quot; gas source, and
      gas panel. The tool is any of the wafer fabrication machines that actually
      apply the gas to the semiconductor media during various stages of the
      fabrication. Actually, one tool might have as many as 15 separate gas
      panels supplying it with different gases. Or, one gas panel might supply
      as many as eight tools with a single gas. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas source is a standard 44-liter gas cylinder. It
      supplies gas to the gas panel, which, in turn, conducts gas to wafer
      processing tools. A second cylinder is used for back-up gas supply, thus
      ensuring uninterrupted gas flow. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas panel, a matrix of stainless-steel tubing and
      pneumatically actuated, normally closed diaphragm valves, is mounted above
      the gas cylinders (see diagram). The valves are monitored and controlled
      using a human-machine interface (HMI) and a programmable logic controller
      (PLC). Control functions include switching the gas supply cylinder as
      needed, providing locations for process and safety sensors and
      implementing the "batch-like" CIP purges. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of variances in process requirements, many purge
      routines are user-specific and must configured by the operator. Purge
      requirements also vary widely with the type of gas used. High specific
      gravity gases are kinetically sluggish and require longer purge times.
      Other gases have tenacious residues. Process gases such as hydrogen
      chloride are particularly "sticky," requiring longer purge times.
      Maintaining higher gas purity also requires longer purges. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylinder changeouts are the most common reasons for purges.
      They require the simplest sequences because only a short section of tubing
      has to be purged before reintroduction of the process gas. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other extreme are system-wide purge routines. These
      can have over 300 discrete, timed steps that include venturi-generated
      evacuations, purge gas pressurizations, and sequenced valve actuations. A
      menu of application-specific purge routines is needed--rather than having
      "one big one do them all"--because some routines take hours to complete,
      whereas others take minutes. Using the correct purge routine is necessary
      because shutting down a fab's processes for longer than necessary is
      expensive. Downtime costs can approach $100,000 per hour! </P>
      <P><B>Redefining the process </B></P>
      <P>In order to improve CIP efficiencies, ALE introduced its Reduced Purge
      Volume (RPV) gas distribution hardware to decrease by half--both from time
      taken and gases lost during a typical CIP purge. ALE chose a control
      system from DST Controls Inc. (Benica, Ca.) to provide the flexibility
      needed for the new "plumbing." DST's OEM control system was developed to
      monitor and execute all of the complex purge--or gas batching--routines
      that ALE's new hardware could now implement. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, wafer fabs also required that the gas
      batching system meet some less precisely defined generic criteria. These
      include flexibility, reliability, low cost, and fast-track development. A
      premium was also placed on user-friendliness, aesthetic appearance, a
      small hardware footprint, and on-time delivery. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for these requirements are due to constraints
      and market pressures, unique to the semiconductor industry. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Flexibility:</B> Fabs are global, so a new controller had to
      be easily configurable to accommodate a wide range of international
      end-users' needs. Customer-specific "moving targets" included unique
      computer/software systems and local area networks, requiring bidirectional, plug-and-play communication. System security requirements
      varied from complex multi-level password access, to key switches, to no
      restrictions at all. Even the PLCs to be used were optional. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Fast-track development:</B> Because of the competitiveness in
      the chip industry and the short commercial life of many semiconductor
      products, new fabs typically must come on-line in a year or less. Vendor
      equipment availability must keep pace with delivery requirements. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Cost:</B> OEM products aimed at fabs are subject to
      competitive forces in a marketplace already flirting with overcapacity.
      New equipment must be "strategically priced." </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Size:</B> Cramped spaces typify fab environments, so the size
      of all equipment matters. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Reliability and user-friendliness:</B> Fabs must deal with
      dangerous gases (arsine, silane, etc.) and the high scrap costs of
      products. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>Aesthetics:</B> The customers fabs deal with are
      sophisticated and high tech. All production equipment must meet these
      criteria in both performance and appearance. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;<B>On-time delivery:</B> Because the fab industry is currently
      the "mother-of-all-buyers' markets," with high financial and operating
      safety risks, poor vendor performance is not tolerated. If there was a fab
      bumper sticker, it would say "Break a promise, go away." </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purging, or clean-in-place, of gas panels is undeniably
      characterized by batch process elements. In fact, it was only after ALE
      and DST Controls viewed the system requirements from a "batch control"
      perspective that the current solution could be developed. &#8226; </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, contact DST Controls: Tel:
      707/745-5117; Fax: 707/745-8952; or <B>Circle 227 </B>on the Reader
      Service Card. </P>
      <P><B>The 'Batch' Solution</B> </P>
      <P><B><img border="0" src="../eImages/eos%20family.GIF" align="left" width="651" height="374">T</B>reating the control design as a batch problem embedded in a
      process environment was the approach used by DST Controls. DST viewed the
      defining characteristic of "batch" as the ordered sequence of controlled
      actions required to produce repeatable final products--in this case,
      molecularly spotless gas vessels. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, ALE's purging application had all three components
      of a batch recipe: formula, procedure, and equipment. Although the same
      generic purge routines would be used for normal cylinder changes and panel
      maintenance, each would be implemented with a different formula,
      configurable by the user for different gases in unique physical
      installations. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these parameters, the controller would then
      repeatedly execute its purge routines, often with over 300 precise steps.
      The steps involved the actuation of multiple valves while monitoring
      variable transducer values to confirm each step's completion. The control
      system was to have the look and feel of a Pentium/Intellution batching
      package--at a monochrome flat-panel price. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The controller's physical design took priority so that its
      assembly could pace software development. Close attention to ergonomic
      principles guided the design, especially for the service access doors and
      panel openings. Electrical design required that all purge options be
      supported with a minimum of I/O points and without module changes,
      rewiring, or DIP-switch reselection. </P>
      <P><B>Software development</B> </P>
      <P>For software development, ALE and DST reverse-engineered an existing
      purge procedure, and recreated it as a 50-page flowchart. New software
      developed from these flowcharts focus on guiding the operator through
      abnormal purging situations by providing detailed on-screen text and
      icons. Operators are alerted to problems that can be addressed and solved
      during a long purge operation, avoiding possible restarting of the
      sequence. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge sequencing contributed the most to program size and
      complexity. Some purges required over 300 steps, no small task for the
      unit's mid-range PLC. Because the required functions hogged PLC memory,
      use of efficient coding was paramount; for example, resetting an index
      value to zero saved two bytes by using a "block clear" instruction instead
      of a 'move' instruction. The current program is one byte short of the 16K
      limit for the selected CPU. Communication between the unit's touchscreen
      and controller has also been optimized, allowing for greatly improved
      screen update times. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease of use and system security also concerned the fab
      operators. Although it has long been considered easiest to navigate these
      options like climbing along the branches of a tree, changes in PC-based
      operating systems now allow operators to "jump sideways to an adjacent
      branch," when necessary. Layout and hierarchy of screens were redesigned,
      allowing quicker, more intuitive navigation and reducing operator training
      time. Since no two customers had the same interpretation of which
      functions should be secured or how, the batch application's recipe was
      extended one further step, implementing a fully customizable security
      system. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual mode is typically the most secure function in any
      customer's eyes. It is assumed that if operators have satisfied all the
      requirements to access manual mode, then they can take responsibility for
      operating the controller safely. However, in order to

</FONT>
 a<FONT face=Arial>ssure absolute system safety, a set of manual interlocks, which step
      an operator through especially hazardous valve sequences, was implemented.
      </P>
      <P><B>A look at the controller</B> </P>
      <P>The controller cabinet is rated NEMA 4. It features a 10-in.
      touchscreen display, alarm horn, LED indicators, key-switch, and an
      emergency-stop button-- mounted in the hinged front cover. The default PLC
      is a GE Fanuc Series 90-30 PLC. It is mounted on a pull-out tray behind
      the shock-mounted cover. Cost, size, memory capacity, expanded
      communication protocol capability, availability of worldwide service, and
      acceptance by the semiconductor industry all played a part in GE Fanuc's
      selection. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the controller must operate in a Class I, Div. 2
      environment, a 16-station, electropneumatic interface card transforms the
      PLCs 24 V dc output signals into nitrogen gas pulses. These pulses then
      actuate the intrinsically safe gas panel valves. The panel's
      sensor/transducers are 4-20 mA or 1-5 V dc, and input directly to the PLC.
      They monitor pressure, flow, and gas cylinder weights, detecting remaining
      gas quantities. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other controller features include: </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;Operator configuration and execution of default and custom purge
      routines. </P>
      <P>&#8226;&nbsp;Fail-safe and interlock gas panel valving, to ensure safe states
