<img border="0" src="../images/Delevan.jpg" alt="PG&amp;E's Delevan Gas Compressor Station" align="left" width="300" height="201">P</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>ortable 
digital assistants </b>are helping with natural gas pipeline data collection at 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E, San Francisco, Calif.), one of the largest 
utility companies in the free world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PG&amp;E pipelines transmit natural gas from source 
wells in Canada to the San Francisco Bay area for retail consumption. Over such 
long distances pressure drops due to friction losses require compressor 
stations, approximately every hundred miles, organized around multiple 10,000 
hp, gas-fired turbines and maintained by PG&amp;E. Typical pipeline throughput can 
exceed 800 million standard cubic feet per day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To keep things safe and running, prudent 
compressor station management can require over 500 instrument readings per day 
at each station. Many of the functions monitored are so critical that problems 
with same, if unattended to, could truly light-up the night sky, and make the 
utility’s current public-relations problems look like “good publicity.” Although 
not “nuke-grade-dangerous,” natural gas is methane a lethally noxious gas and a 
high-energy explosive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Low cost, safety go hand in hand</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<img border="0" src="../images/Internal%20Eng.jpg" alt="Too old and costly to hang sensors" align="left" width="300" height="423">PG&amp;E opted out of fully automating its data 
acquisition system because it would have been cost prohibitive, and more 
importantly, not entirely safe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Much of PG&amp;E’s compressor station instrumentation 
is just too far-flung to be hard-wired cost effectively. Furthermore, many of 
the thousands of gauges and meters that must be read daily, throughout the 
utility’s archipelago of pipeline compressor stations, are old, mechanical, or 
otherwise too costly to match up with transducers or hang on a local area 
network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As noted, some compressor station instrumentation 
monitors process parameters so critical, that despite advances in (and PG&amp;E’s 
use of) remote SCADA technology, PG&amp;E also employs hand-held data acquisition to 
ensure that a human will always “absolutely positively” be right there to verify 
proper functions of life-safety systems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The utility recently chose to use data collection 
devices that might have been previously dismissed by traditional plant-floor 
thinking as “cheap commercial-grade,” but PG&amp;E recognized that much of this 
equipment is now reliable enough for many industrial situations. This is largely 
due to advances in semiconductor manufacturing that create more robust IC 
components. Additionally, advances in industrial ruggedization (shock-proofing 
and liquid-proofing) with low-cost molded rubber coatings and impact resistant 
plastic packaging offer even more protection to the increasingly tougher 
electronics inside. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Need for data</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Critical data that PG&amp;E records and archives at 
least once daily include:<img border="0" src="../images/emerg%20shutdn%20sm.JPG" alt="Makes reading non-automation instruments fast and easy" align="right" width="300" height="225"></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Number of starts and total hours run by each 
  compressor</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Compressor engine oil pressure/ temperature</font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Oil filter differential pressure</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lubricating oil level</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Air intake differential pressure</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Compressor-seal oil differential pressure</font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Compressor turbine fuel flow rate</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ambient temperature and relevant weather 
  conditions</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fuel gas pressure</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Turbine bearing vibration readings</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Cooling water level, pressure, and 
  temperature. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although much of the data is redundantly 
collected by PG&amp;E’s local SCADA system, the use of a hand-held system to gather 
data provides regular human presence and an “eye on things” that can help avoid 
disasters. Undetected lubricant spills that can cause groundwater contamination, 
unusual equipment conditions that may be precursors to equipment failure, and 
other localized anomalies can be observed and reported. Case in point: at one 
site, an unfortunate cat strayed into the draft of a compressor-cooling fan. 
Thunk! The fan kept running, so the alarm wasn’t triggered, but visual 
inspection revealed the necessity to shut the fan down for cleaning, repair, and 
balancing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, even the most automated systems 
experience “glitches” that interrupt data flow, necessitating manual backup to 
ensure plant integrity and required regulatory agency data. So, in spite of PG&amp;E 
compressor stations designed for unattended operation, maintenance technicians 
still walk inspection routes daily, providing back-up to local SCADA, and the 
only data collection for process variables not monitored automatically. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A look at the problem</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<img border="0" src="../images/1700%20w%20screen.jpg" alt="A database you can hold - dBeHold!" align="left" width="369" height="492">In the past, use of clipboards and proprietary 
data collection devices kept pipeline equipment working and safe. However, these 
tools were inefficient, costly, and not always accurate. Clipboards just 
produced reams of dirty, dog-eared paper, erratically garnished with grease 
spots and dull-penciled scribbling. These readings then had to be deciphered, 
sorted, archived, and eventually transcribed via keyboard to PG&amp;E’s database. 
Omissions and transcription errors haunted the system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Proprietary industrial hand-held devices were 
also tried. They didn’t eliminate transcription errors and suffered other 
drawbacks including limited functionality and high costs to buy and maintain. 
Single-line displays could not be customized for easy entry of data from gauges 
and meters with dissimilar data formats. Finally, there was no way to produce 
alarms for out-of-range entries from human error or meter malfunction. The 
handhelds tried accepted any data no matter how preposterous. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Application challenges</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PG&amp;E engineers in charge of the Delevan 
compressor station, just north of Sacramento, Calif., brought in DST Controls, a 
control system integrator from Benicia, Calif., to find a solution. DST’s 
experience with personal digital assistants (PDAs) in a previous project lead it 
to investigate their use for PG&amp;E’s data acquisition problem. The basic idea was 
to use an “open” handheld computer, in this case a Palm OS device with 
integrated barcode scanner from Symbol Technologies (Holtsville, N.Y.). e 
common.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Indeed, even with the integrated barcode scanner, 
a hybrid Palm device would still be a fraction of the size and cost of the WWII 
walkie-talkie-sized devices previously tried by PG&amp;E. Additionally, Palm OS was, 
by comparison, an “open” system, allowing almost unlimited customization of the 
operator interface and data handling process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Major design problems included:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Resolution of the classic ergonomic conundrum 
  of more data points on fewer screens vs. less data points on more screens, 
  that is, easy screen navigation vs. easy screen reading. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Development of an intuitive application to 
  minimize training time. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ensuring that data could not accidentally be 
  resubmitted to the database if several users independently read the same 
  devices on the same day. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Enabling the application to reject mistakenly 
  entered out-of-range data. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Enabling the PDA to automatically recognize 
  specific instruments being polled. (One less opportunity for human error.)
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prevention of system conflicts that could 
  occur if a PDA is removed from its “cradle” during upload. Because data are 
  deleted from the device after upload to ready it for the next shift, problems 
  could arise if the deletion process were interrupted, allowing old data to be 
  resent to the database during the next upload. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The system also had to be 
flexible enough in operation to allow technicians to easily change their 
inspection routes, or to add or delete data points while on route. In addition, 
the operating software would have to be “open” enough to allow transfer of data 
into any of several database programs, including Microsoft Access, SQL Server, 
Oracle, any ODBC-compliant database, and proprietary HMI databases. The handheld 
also had to be Class I, Div. II compliant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Filling the gap</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<img border="0" src="../images/ControlPanel1.jpg" alt="Data is brought back to the control room without errors" align="left" width="300" height="200">Because data collection was not fully automated 
at the compressor stations, DST Controls did not have to spend time dealing with 
existing esoteric data formats. The system’s database was designed from scratch 
around Microsoft SQL Server. Database programming was accomplished using 
Microsoft ADO and OLE DB tools. One of the benefits of this approach was that 
the application ended up being small. However, size varies with how much data 
PG&amp;E wants to keep on this hand-held computer. The current application enables 
saving 30-day data histories in the handheld before the need to delete or 
upload. Screen development and programming takes place in a Visual Basic-like 
environment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because the applications (ClearControls dBeHold 
and ClearControls dB) DST Controls developed do not conflict with standard Palm 
OS applications, PG&amp;E’s handhelds retain all basic Palm OS features.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because upload to the PDA is via an integrated 
barcode scanner, each piece of monitored equipment is labeled with a unique Code 
3 of 9 (or Code 39) barcode. Code 39 is easy to print and is used extensively in 
industrial applications. It is also the easiest to use of alphanumeric barcodes 
and is designed for character self-checking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><font size="2">How it works</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<img border="0" src="../images/dBeHold%20Laser%20300.JPG" alt="dBeHold with optional laser bar code scanner" align="left" width="300" height="400">When a technician, armed with the handheld 
barcode scanner, approaches an instrument to poll, the following takes place:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Using the stylus, the user first calls up the 
Data Entry screen by tapping the “New Reading” button on the PDA. The 
instrument’s identification number is then entered by either scanning the 
meter’s barcode or manually by using “Graffiti” (Palm’s calligraphic technology) 
or on-screen keypad. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once the instrument ID is entered, its 
description automatically appears, as does the “Last-Read” value for that 
device. Once the new value is entered, tapping “Enter” saves the record. If the 
operator makes an entry the system deems “out-of-range,” DST’s proprietary Palm 
application, “dBehold,” will alarm and prompt for data reentry. This then 
prompts a visual inspection of the meter by the technician to determine if it 
was a transcription error or an equipment problem. The parameters of “in range” 
readings for each instrument are user-configurable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If an equipment fault is discovered, the user can 
flag it for maintenance using the device’s “Maint/Req” box. Mis-entered data are 
easily corrected manually. All screens have a “Comments” field for additional 
textual notes on any abnormal conditions, again via Graffiti or keyboard. At the 
end of the shift, the device is returned to its cradle and the “HotSync” button 
is pushed. This action initiates upload of the data to the station’s database 
PC, where PG&amp;E’s corporate SCADA system later retrieves it.</font></p>
<p><a target="content" href="../ClearStuff/clear_dBeHold.htm">
  <img border="0" src="../eImages/palmlogo.gif" alt="DST is a Palm Select Alliance Program Member!" align="right" width="78" height="78"></a><font face="Arial" size="2">Gabriel Acosta-Lopez, senior director of platform 
development services for Palm Inc., is not surprised that Palm OS devices filled 
PG&amp;E’s bill. According to Mr. Acosta-Lopez, “We are seeing increased 
appreciation in the plant environment for tough, inexpensive, and versatile 
handhelds. This trend should continue as more Palm OS partners “morph” hand-held 
products for industrial use with custom software and hardware add-ons.” </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Software makes it happen </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<img border="0" src="../images/tagedit2.jpg" align="left" alt="Customize your tags using ClearControls dBedit" width="482" height="600">Software components of the PG&amp;E hand-held system 
include standard bundled Palm OS Desktop software, including HotSync Manager 
(used to upload Palm devices to a PC) and DST Controls’ proprietary 
ClearControls dB and ClearControls dBeHold applications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ClearControls dB is the Windows application that 
runs on a PC and transfers data between the hand-held device and PG&amp;E’s GE Fanuc 
Cimplicity database. It also allows supervisors to add/modify/ delete user 
access and information. For example, the application can be password-protected 
tying database modifications to predefined user privilege. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ClearControls dBeHold is the software that runs 
on the hand-held device (Palm OS, or WinCE/Pocket PC) for the purpose of 
managing entries and sending them to ClearControls dB. Use of this software can 
also be password protected. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
<img border="0" src="../images/Geo%20Meters%20small.jpg" alt="Author taking reading with dBeHold" align="right" width="300" height="199"></b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">The system is being integrated into each PG&amp;E 
compressor station’s data acquisition system. It will make data files available 
to staff engineers over PG&amp;E’s intranet and interact with PG&amp;E’s condition-based 
maintenance and work management systems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Commercial hand-held computing systems continue 
to evolve rapidly, driven by the shear volume of demand in that marketplace. 
Because of this, more and more unnecessarily “bullet-proof” industrial “smart” 
devices, that are short on functionality and long on price, will be challenged 
by “rubber-coated” invaders that are long on functionality and very short on 
price. </font></p>
