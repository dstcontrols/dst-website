            control engineers or system integrators have designed a control 
            system and decided what instruments, controllers, PLCs, and 
            associated electronics/communication paraphernalia will be required 
            to make it function, the search for “real estate” in which to house 
            the more delicate components begins. For the most part, 
            everything—delicate or not—goes into some kind of box. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The reasons for using enclosures 
            range from housekeeping to explosion protection. Whether the 
            application is continuous or discrete manufacturing, even the 
            simplest installations are made up of many interconnected 
            components. Simply providing an enclosed “mounting” on which to wire 
            a control loop neatly and conveniently is the basic function of most 
            enclosures. Protecting instruments, controllers, and actuators from 
            the manufacturing environment and, in some cases, where the 
            manufacturing environment is flammable or explosive, protecting the 
            environment from them, represents more advanced functionality.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Take your pick</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Enclosures are commercially available 
            in a wide variety of materials. According to a recent Control 
            Engineering/Cahners Research survey, carbon steel, is still the most 
            purchased variety at 73%. Of respondents, 61% purchased stainless 
            steel, 38% fiberglass, 36% aluminum, and 27% engineered plastic. The 
            survey of 10,000 Control Engineering subscribers in April had an 8% 
            response. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Advances in nonmetallic materials 
            have contributed to their increased popularity in enclosures. 
            Lighter than steel, they were structurally inferior to metallic 
            enclosures. However, in smaller sizes, nonmetallic boxes now compete 
            favorably in UL/CSA mechanical tests. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Bill Southard, P.E., president of 
            system integrator, DST Controls (Benicia, Calif.), says, </b>
            “Fiberglass, polycarbonate, and ABS enclosures are usually only used 
            in corrosive environments. Lighter and cheaper than stainless steel, 
            they lack its structural strength and, as such, are limited in size 
            to 6 ft2. An exception is fiberglass enclosures, which can be quite 
            large—making you feel like you are wiring inside a Port-a-Potty.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Molded products have other advantages 
            that make them desirable substitutes for conventional fabricated 
            metal enclosures. In general, nonmetallic enclosures do not conduct, 
            which eliminates the need for box (but not component) grounding. 
            However, a static charge can build up on their surfaces, which can 
            discharge and cause arcing—an unacceptable situation in hazardous 
            locations. Recent material developments include an antistatic 
            fiberglass material that allows static to run to ground, while 
            retaining the nonconductive nature of the box. This prevents stray 
            current from the electrical components within from leaking to the 
            surface of the enclosure. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, molded enclosures offer 
            generously rounded corners and inside radii that are easy to hose, 
            steam, or scrub down in sanitary applications. “Because of the 
            molded nature of the boxes, they can usually be sealed better 
            against the elements than steel enclosures,”<b> adds Mr. Southard.
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Heavy metal applications </b>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even with nonmetallic enclosures 
            making advances into specialty applications, steel still accounts 
            for the greater majority of applications. Structurally, both carbon 
            and stainless steel have plenty of structural strength for all 
            applications. Cheap and tough, they are heavy—probably their biggest 
            drawback, especially in larger sizes. Aluminum enclosures can be 
            used in applications where weight is an issue. However, these 
            enclosures do not have the strength of their steel counterparts.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next to its strength and inherent 
            nonflammability, the greatest advantage of the metal enclosure is 
            ease of fabrication, which accounts for their low initial cost, 
            ready availability, and the wide variety of types and styles. 
            Additionally, when required, custom, highly aesthetic applications 
            are easily fabricated using simple manufacturing techniques, such as 
            brake shearing/bending/forming, welding, and painting/powder 
            coating.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the looks of indoor 
            applications survive well under most environmental conditions, <b>
            DST Controls’ Bill Southard </b>is quick to respond that, “Despite 
            its durability, a carbon steel enclosure can and will rust no matter 
            how well it is painted if left exposed to the elements.” To put it 
            another way, beauty is only skin deep, but functionality goes all 
            the way to the bone. &quot;</font></p>
