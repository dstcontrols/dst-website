DST's electrical contractor's license number is CA# 466808. Hence we can take full responsibility for installation as well as all other phases of an automation project. Completed DST-projects&mdash;with installation&mdash;include: drum conveyor systems in New Jersey; bottling-line quality control systems in Texas; and hazardous gas control in Taiwan.</td>

When appropriate, we will also act as a "sub" to electrical or mechanical contractors and assist those entities in whatever technical aspects of installation and start-up they wish to off-load.</td>
